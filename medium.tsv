Sentence
Don’t misunderstand: I know I’m supposed to care about data.
I’m supposed to end that opening sentence by saying, “but I’m working hard to improve my analytical chops.”
But the truth is, I’m really not.
Instead, I’m working hard to improve my creative chops.
It’s what I love.
It’s what I was put on this earth to do.
I aspire to create things that make you feel stuff and think stuff and want to spend more time with more of that stuff.
Now, I’m no fool.
I know I’ll look far better if I claim that I’m data-driven.
After all, I’ve worked for online startups and tech companies my entire career.
We’re the crowd responsible for the data-first ways currently permeating even the most analytics-agnostic fields.
I know I’m supposed to say I care a ton about data.
But, well … I just don’t.
We pretend to care.
But we don’t really care.
We really care about our craft.
We really care about what our intuition is urging us to try.
We really care about making things others like — nay, love.
And as it just so happens, this is the skill that many businesses are starting to realize they need but can’t often find.
Not caring about data seems insane (dare I say, unthinkable), but it’s made us valuable to companies and clients and customers all the same.
Because rather than get 1.2x the results through optimization, we strive for 10x the results through creation.
We aim high.
We’re comfortable doing the crazy.
We’re major players in a game that consumers are winning because they have all the choice.
I’ll confess: the problem isn’t really “numbers.” The problem isn’t even in starting with the numbers.
(Sometimes, it’s good to start with data.
Sometimes, not.)
Instead, the problem lies in how most organizations use those numbers: as sources of answers.
The data says X, so let’s do X.
Rather than find a deeper insight, ask questions, sit with customers, or unleash the creative firepower of the team … we default to the conventional wisdom or the past precedent.
So, no, we don’t care about data — not the way most companies interpret data.
We care about insights, but unless we’re speaking plain English, we’re not talking about insights just yet.
(Note: We’d be fine with interpretive dance, too, just … don’t do the worm.)
We don’t care so much about the numbers.
To us, this is about making something others are afraid to say out loud in the working world: art.
That’s a scary word in our space.
Why?
Sounds a whole lot like the stuff we’re supposed to be making for work.
So what do we care about?
People.
Us.
You.
The audience.
People hold the answer, always.
Your technology is there to amplify your people.
Your analytics is there to track other people.
This is a game of unleashing the very best in your people, and finding solutions to the very worst in the people you wish to serve.
It’s never about the wand.
It’s always the wizard that holds the true power.
And we, the creative people, aspire to unleash our full potential.
We don’t do so by caring about data.
We do so by caring about making great art.
And our leading indicator of the art we should make is the overlap between what WE want to create (intuition) and what others react emotionally to consuming (qualitative feedback).
That is the shift from “acting like a publisher” (hitting “publish” more often, more quickly) to aspiring to be The Washington Post of our niche … the ESPN of our space … or “The Daily Show” of our industry.
So, care about data?
No thank you.
Gasp and clutch your pearls all you want.
“But, but you’re being too emotional here!
But, but SEO is a great tool that can — and, and everyone on Medium is writing about — but we have monthly metrics to — and we have proof and processes and science…”
No, shhh-shhh, there-there.
You’re not listening.
See, I know all that.
I know I should care.
But all I care about … is making you feel.
Does your data get me there?
Great, tell me how.
Does my intuition get me there?
11 outta 10 times it does.
In a world where others barely spend time with anything, I’m here to acquire and retain minutes or hours, not seconds.
I’m here to trigger emotional responses, not clicks.
I’m here to avoid creating more down-the-fairway, blend-into-the-noise, just-do-that-thing-again junk … because “that’s the best practice.”
Buy.
BUY: Hire people not because their resumes fit some kind of mold but precisely because their portfolios break it.
BUY: Question the experts and the best practice.
Look, I know everything in this article sounds utterly insane.
I know that.
I do.
I’m no dummy.
My brain is fighting against my gut every day, urging me to spend more time in Google Analytics, and screaming at me to click that link shared by that expert.
I could be missing THE best way to do my work!
But what if … my gut is right?
What if I actually possessed this ability to arrive at the idea or the answer more quickly and with more confidence?
What if that skill could be honed over time, getting more and more accurate as it also gets faster?
Because maybe the idea that art isn’t good business is actually the wrong idea.
Maybe real artists ship more and better work than anyone else thinks possible, just because they don’t see what the artist sees — because maybe they don’t care about what the artist cares about.
Maybe.
I don’t know for sure.
But something is telling me I’m right.
So I confess, with you as my witness: I don’t care too much about the numbers.
But I’m utterly obsessed with producing the things that produce the numbers.
