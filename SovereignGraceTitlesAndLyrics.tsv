Sentence
As Long as You Are Glorified
Shall I take from Your hand Your blessings
Yet not welcome any pain
Shall I thank You for days of sunshine
Yet grumble in days of rain
Shall I love You in times of plenty
Then leave You in days of drought
Shall I trust when I reap a harvest
But when winter winds blow, then doubt

Oh let Your will be done in me
In Your love I will abide
Oh I long for nothing else as long
As You are glorified

Are You good only when I prosper
And true only when I'm filled
Are You King only when I'm carefree
And God only when I'm well
You are good when I'm poor and needy
You are true when I'm parched and dry
You still reign in the deepest valley
You're still God in the darkest night

So quiet my restless heart
Quiet my restless heart
Quiet my restless heart in you

Oh let Your will be done in me
In Your love I will abide
Oh I long for nothing else as long
As You are glorified
O Great God
O great God of highest heaven
Occupy my lowly heart
Own it all and reign supreme
Conquer every rebel power
Let no vice or sin remain
That resists Your holy war
You have loved and purchased me
Make me Yours forevermore

I was blinded by my sin
Had no ears to hear Your voice
Did not know Your love within
Had no taste for heaven's joys
Then Your Spirit gave me life
Opened up Your Word to me
Through the gospel of Your Son
Gave me endless hope and peace

Help me now to live a life
That's dependent on Your grace
Keep my heart and guard my soul
From the evils that I face
You are worthy to be praised
With my every thought and deed
O great God of highest heaven
Glorify Your Name through me

You are worthy to be praised

And courage to speak
Perform Your wondrous deeds
Through those who are weak
Lord use us as You want, whatever the test

I Come Running
Jesus I am blind be my light
Darkened in my mind be my wisdom
Bend my stubborn will to Your own
Open up my ears to hear Your Spirit
Melt my conscience once again
Help me hate the slightest sin
And when Satan comes to tempt me

I come running to You when I fear when I'm tried
I come running to You to Your blood to Your side
And there my soul finds rest
There my soul finds rest in You

Shepherd of my soul lead me on
To the pastures green in Your scriptures
Make me to lie down by waters still
Fill me with Your peace in the tempest
I take my refuge in Your cross
By Your sacrifice I'm washed
And when Satan comes accusing

I come running to You when I fear when I'm tried
I come running to You to Your blood to Your side
And there my soul finds rest
There my soul finds rest in You

Once I was Your foe a slave to sin
A stranger to Your love a hopeless outcast
But You have brought me near
I'm bought with blood
Now I'm Your precious child an heir with Jesus
You pour heav'n into my soul
Your wondrous love it overflows
And I marvel how You love me

I come running to You when I fear when I'm tried
I come running to You to Your blood to Your side
And there my soul finds rest
There my soul finds rest in You

My soul finds rest
My sould finds rest in You
When I'm burned,
When I'm tired,
When I'm cold, lost my fire
When I'm weary in this race
I will run and seek Your face
How Deep
You were broken that I might be healed
You were cast off that I might draw near
You were thirsty that I might come drink
Cried out in anguish that I might sing

How deep is Your love
How high and how wide is Your mercy
How deep is Your grace
Our hearts overflow with praise
To You

You knew darkness that I might know light
Wept great tears that mine might be dried
Stripped of glory that I might be clothed
Crushed by Your Father to call me Your own
Heavenly Father, Beautiful Son
Father, You loved me
Sent Your Son to redeem

And brought me to Christ

Open hand is outstretched

The fountain of grace that overflows

In the Valley
When You lead me to the valley of vision
I can see You in the heights
And though my humbling
Wouldn't be my decision
It's here Your glory shines so bright
So let me learn that the cross
Precedes the crown
To be low is to be high
That the valley's where You make me
More like Christ

Let me find Your grace in the valley
Let me find Your life in my death
Let me find Your joy in my sorrow
Your wealth in my need
That You're near with every breath
In the valley

In the daytime there are stars in the heavens
But they only shine at night
And the deeper that I go into darkness
The more I see their radiant light
So let me learn that my losses are my gain
To be broken is to heal
That the valley's where Your power is revealed

Let me find Your grace in the valley
Let me find Your life in my death
Let me find Your joy in my sorrow
Your wealth in my need
That You're near with every breath
In the valley

Let me find Your joy in my sorrow
Your wealth in my need
That You're near with every breath
In the valley

You're near to me

Wise men saw a starry sign
And left their homes behind for You
We too have seen the Morning Star
And hope has filled our hearts anew
So like the wise men we will come

And we will seek You
We will seek You
We will seek You
Who sought us out to make us new

Wise men traveled long and far
Following the star of God
But You've come closer than the air
You brought us near by Your own blood
So like the wise men we will come

And we will seek You
We will seek You
We will seek You
Who sought us out to make us new
We will seek You

Wise men came with gifts of gold
Frankincense and myrrh for You

Gratefulness and praise to You
So like the wise men we will come

And we will seek You
We will seek You
We will seek You
Who sought us out to make us new
Who sought us out to make us new

Rejoice
We do not have the lyrics for Rejoice yet.
Glory Be to God
Glory be to God on high
Let peace on earth descend
God comes down before our eyes
To Bethlehem
God invisible appears
Endless ages wrapped in years
He has come who cannot change
And Jesus is His name

Emptied of His majesty
He comes in human form
Being’s source begins to be
And God is born
All our griefs He’ll gladly share
All our sins He’ll fully bear
He will cover our disgrace
And suffer in our place

Let the joyful news ring out
The Prince of Peace proclaim
Lift your heart and voice to shout
Immanuel’s name
God has kept His promises
What a work of grace this is
Son of Mary, chosen One
The Lamb of God has come

Hosanna, hosanna
The Lamb of God has come
Hosanna, hosanna
He is the promised One

Glory be to God on high
Let peace on earth descend
God comes down before our eyes
To Bethlehem
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
We have come today to worship
We have come to praise the One
Who came down into our darkness
Born a lowly virgin's son
You who did not come with splendor
Pomp and strength and majesty
You who came to us in weakness
Born to us in poverty

Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel
In You alone we hope and trust
Jesus, Savior, God with us
Emmanuel

We were blind and lost and godless
Wandering a trackless waste
Then hope arose, a glorious beacon
Like the star the wise men chased
Down from heaven came a Savior
Born a child, so small and frail
Taking up our pain and troubles
Conquering where we had failed

You who with a word created
Sun and moon and seas and sand
Lay there sleeping in a manger
Cradled by Your mother's hand
You who made the mighty forests
Would lie down upon a tree
Fastened there with nails for sinners
Would bleed and die to set us free
Hope Has Come
How my happy heart rejoices
I can hear the angel voices
"Christ is born" they all are singing
From the sky this good news bringing
Let the earth rejoice
O come and lift your voices

Christ the Lord is born today
He came from heaven's throne
God is born a man today
To bring His children home
To bring His children home

Death and darkness surely tremble
Light has come to all the people
The Lion comes to crush the serpent
He comes a Lamb, a lowly servant
Let the earth rejoice
O come and lift your voices

Christ the Lord is born today
He came from heaven's throne
God is born a man today
To bring His children home
To bring His children home

God has sent His greatest treasure
Shown His love in greatest measure
Sending Christ to bleed and suffer
Purchasing our joy forever
Let the earth rejoice
O come and lift your voices

Christ the Lord is born today
He came from heaven's throne
God is born a man today
To bring His children home
To bring His children home

Christ the Lord is born today
He came from heaven's throne
God is born a man today
To bring His children home
To bring His children home
In My Heart
In my heart there is a stirring
One that did not start with me
A love to worship my Creator
To show His love for all to see

I will worship
I will honor
I will exalt the Lord above
All my days
I'll sing the praises
Of His great redeeming love

In my heart there is a treason
One that poisons all my love
Take my heart and consecrate it
Wash it in Your cleansing blood

Tie me to the Rock unchanging
Tie me to His wondrous Cross
I'll fix my eyes upon the Savior
All other things I count as loss
Only Jesus
Father of grace, You've sacrificed
Your only Son for us, the crucified Jesus
Enlarge our hearts to love Your Son
O grant to us the grace to walk with Him always
To make Him our great delight
Bringing worship with our lives
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
Give us Jesus, we cry
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
The Pearl of greatest price
Spirit of grace, You've shed Your light
Upon our darkened eyes, unveiling Jesus Christ
Come change our hearts, conform our ways
To honor Jesus' Name, His glory our ain
Let His love compel our own
As we worship at His throne
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
Give us Jesus, we cry
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
The Pearl of greatest price
Jesus, our great Savior,
Lord of heaven, Son of God
Jesus, our great Savior,
Lord of heaven, Son of God
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
Give us Jesus, we cry
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
The Pearl of greatest price
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
Give us Jesus, we cry
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
The Pearl of greatest price
End
The Precious Blood
Before the cross I kneel and see
The measure of my sin
How You became a curse for me
Though You were innocent
The magnitude of Your great love
Was shown in full degree
When righteous blood, the crimson spill
Rained down from Calvary

Oh, the precious blood
That flowed from Mercy's side
Washed away my sin
When Christ my Savior died
Oh, the precious blood
Of Christ the crucified
It speaks for me before Your throne
Where I stand justified

And who am I that I should know
This treasure of such worth
My Savior's pure atoning blood
Shed for the wrath I'd earned
For sin has stained my every deed
My every word and thought
What wondrous love that makes me one
Your priceless blood has bought

A crown of thorns, pierced hands and feet
A body bruised, and Mercy's plea
It Was Love
It was love that brought You from above
To walk upon the earth
And love that caused Your weariness
Your hunger and Your thirst
It was love that caused You to be tried
And tempted by the foe
And love that brought the nails and cross
And love that bought my soul

How wonderful Your love, the mystery of mysteries
Filling up my heart, more glorious than I know
How wonderful Your love
There's nothing else so sweet to me
I'll never be apart from the Lover of my soul
From the Lover of my soul

Your love is filled with holiness
O Spirit, fan this flame
Your love will never cease or cool
Your love will never change
O let me see Your love for me
Around me everywhere
The shining sun, a gentle rain
Remind me of Your care
So I will Trust You
Almighty Maker, Universe shaper
You put the stars into space
Yet You descended, You have befriended
Those who had hated Your name, just like me

King of Glory, I know You love me
So I will trust You, yes I will trust You
God Almighty, You have saved me
So I will trust You, yes I will trust in You

Lord over nations, King of Creation
Heaven and earth bow to You
I am Your child, I've been reconciled
With tender affection You drew me to You

King of Glory, I know You love me
So I will trust You, yes I will trust You
God Almighty, You have saved me
So I will trust You, yes I will trust in You

How could I not trust my King?
The One who has formed me and shaped me
I will rejoice and will sing
For the One who has made me has saved me

King of Glory, I know You love me
I will trus in You, I will trust in You

King of Glory, I know You love me
So I will trust You, yes I will trust You
God Almighty, You have saved me
So I will trust You, yes I will trust in You
Hide Away in the Love of Jesus
Come, weary saints, though tired and weak
Hide away in the love of Jesus
Your strength will return by His quiet streams
Hide away in the love of Jesus
Come, wandering souls, and find your home
Hide away in the love of Jesus
He offers the rest that you yearn to know
Hide away in the love of Jesus
Hear Him calling your name
See the depths of His love
In the wounds of His grace
Hide away
Come, guilty ones weighed down with sin
Hide away in the love of Jesus
The freedom you long for is found in Him
Hide away in the love of Jesus
Come, hopeless hearts, do not despair
Hide away in the love of Jesus
For ten thousand joys await you there
Hide away in the love of Jesus
You Never Change
Father of lights, giver of gifts
There is no shadow in You
Author of life, Fountain of grace
Each morning Your mercies are new

And You never change, and You never lie
Age to age You are the same
I will trust in You, all Your faithfulness
For I know You never change

Father of love, source of all good
Tower of strength and my shield
When You gave Your Son for those who rebelled
Your love for the world was revealed

Father of peace, help of the weak
Though mountains fall into the sea
Though tempests may rage, the sun hide its face
Your favor will rest upon me
Prepared a Place for Me
Mystery of mysteries
That God would make for me
A place within His family, though once His enemy
The Judge of every sinner sent Christ to Calvary
To prepare a place for me

Judgment should be given
For this guilt upon my head
But the Father of all glory crushed His Son instead
Now I've been adopted, for God made this to be
You prepared a place for me

Blessed be, blessed be
My God and Savior, You've shown me favor
And prepared a place for me

Father, in the moment
When Your Son shall split the skies
And myriads of angels acclaim Him with their cries
By grace I will be able to join the jubilee
You prepared a place for me
You Made Us Your Own
We were ruined in our sin
We were guilty and undone
When Your love reached down with sovereign hands
And beckoned us to come

You sought out the wanderers
Made the prodigals come home
With a lavish feast You welcomed us
For You made us Your own

You have loved us like You love Your Son
We are heirs with Christ, bought by His blood
Oh how great the love that we've been shown
We're Your children now, You made us Your own

We are strangers to the world
But no strangers to Your throne
We draw near You now with confidence
For all our fears are gone

And when Christ our King returns
We'll meet saints we've never known
And forever we will be amazed
That You made us Your own
Undying Love
My ears had heard of You, now I have seen
This bitter sweetness in Your agony
My heart was far from You, but You drew me near
With loving kindness dried every tear

And I can see You
Bearing all my shame on the cross
I can hear You cry out, "It is done"
O Jesus, Your sacrifice was more than enough
In Your death I see undying love

My heart is broken and I'm down on my knees
To see my Savior suffering for me
But You descended, lifting me up
Washing my feet, filling my cup
We Sing
We've come together in Your name
We've come together to proclaim
How great You are
Once we were going our own ways
Now we're a people for Your praise
How great You are

We sing as sons and daughters
Sing to God our Father
All because of Jesus
We sing, His blood has bought us
Sing, Your mercy called us
All because of Jesus we sing

Jesus, You're powerful to save
Jesus, You've risen from the grave
How great You are
Your blood gave us peace with God
Your love has broken down our walls
How great You are

By grace we have been saved
To be Your dwelling place
You took our curse and made us one
It's nothing we could do
Our only boast is You
So we rejoice in what You've done
You Gave Your Son
Father, compassionate and tender
Your ears are ever open to my prayers
Father, You feed the crying ravens
You daily lift the burdens that I bear
So I will thank You for Your mercy

You gave Your Son
Righteous One for the defiled
You gave Your Son
By His blood we're reconciled
To our God

Father, You know that I grow weary
I need You to draw near me and be my strength
Father, I long to know Your presence
For You're the joy of heaven and my King
So I will thank You for Your mercy

Whom have I in heaven but You
And none on earth compares with You
Precious Children
Broken and defiled
Clinging to our filth
We gloried in our shame
Running far from You
Still Your mercy sought and saved us

Hallelujah
We belong to You
You have washed our stains
And have raised us up with Christ
Precious children in Your eyes

You gave Your only Son
Your joy and Your delight
You nailed Him to the cross
You crushed Him for our sin
How could you love us like You love Him
The Greatest of All
The greatest of all transactions
The costliest purchase price
Father, Your Son's atoning death
Was given in payment for mine
To buy me back from slavery
To set me free from my chains

Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
Redeemed through Your infinite mercy
Your child forever I am

Now I'll never know Your judgment
You ransomed and saved my soul
Jesus, Your death and Yours alone
Has canceled the debt that I owed
You satisfied the law's demand
And new life's been given to me
God Delights In You
Calling every daughter
Calling every son
All who've been adopted
Through a sacrifice of love
There's no need for you to fear
Your debts have all been cleared

Calling all the downcast
Who feel like they're alone
Anyone who's longing
For a family of their own
God's prepared a place for you
He's calling you to

Come and sing, come and dance
The Father's singing over you
Come rejoice and be glad
For God delights in you, in you

Calling all who've wandered
Gone off on their own
Anyone who wonders
If they're welcome back at home
The God of grace makes all things new
He's calling you to

You chose us to be the objects of Your love
In spite of all we have done
You gave Your beloved Son to die for us
To make us daughters and sons
Completely Done
What reason have I to doubt
Why would I dwell in fear
When all I have known is grace
My future in Christ is clear
My sins have been paid in full

There's no condemnation here
I live in the good of this
My Father has brought me near
I'm leaving my fears behind me now

The old is gone, the new has come
What You complete is completely done
We're heirs with Christ, the victory won
What You complete is completely done

I don't know what lies ahead
What if I fail again
You are my confidence
You'll keep me to the end
I'm leaving my fears behind me now

The old is gone, the new has come
What You complete is completely done
We're heirs with Christ, the victory won
What You complete is completely done

The old is gone, the new has come
The Prodigal
You held out Your arms, I walked away
Insolent, I spurned Your face
Squandering the gifts You gave to me
Holding close forbidden things
Destitute, a rebel still, a fool in all my pride
The world I once enjoyed is death to me
No joy, no hope, no life

Where now are the friends that I had bought
Gone with every penny lost
What hope could there be for such as I
Sold out to a world of lies
Oh to see Your face again, it seems so distant now
Could it be that You would take me back
A servant in Your house

You held out Your arms, I see them still
You never left, You never will
Running to embrace me, now I know
Your cords of love will always hold
Mercy's robe, a ring of grace
Such favor undeserved
You sing over me and celebrate
The rebel now Your child
Who Made Me to Know You
Who made me to know You, but You
When dead in sin You gave me new life
Now my heart is filled with love for You, Jesus

Father, thank You for Your Spirit's work in me
For opening my eyes to the Christ of Calvary
Jesus, You gave Your life in exchange for mine
Now I will live for You who died, Jesus

You placed a crown of grace on my head
You covered me in robes of righteousness
Forever I will always be Yours, Jesus
In You Alone
You spoke and time began
Light dawned at Your command
And by Your Word the earth began to move
Carved mountains with Your hands
Breathed life into all men
You made it all and saw that it was good

There is no rival to You, O God
All kings and idols will one day fall

Who among the gods is like You?
Who could ever measure
All You've done, O God?
Creator, Sustainer, Merciful Savior
Forever on Your throne,
You stand alone

Your Spirit gave the Law
In kindness to us all
And though we never kept it, You were true
Lawmaker, You have saved
Lawbreakers from the grave
And by Your Son our guilt has been removed

Your endless glory shines through Your Son
There is no story of greater love

Who among the gods is like You?
Who could ever measure
All You've done, O God?
Creator, Sustainer, Merciful Savior
Forever on Your throne,
You stand alone

There is no one like our God (You stand alone)

Who among the gods is like You?
Who could ever measure
All You've done, O God?
Creator, Sustainer, Merciful Savior
Forever on Your throne,
You stand alone
At the Foot of the Cross
Beneath the Cross of Jesus
Lord, I would spend my days
In the shadow of the One
Who ransomed me
May I not become familiar
With its marvelous good news
But live my life with it
Always in my view

At the foot of the Cross
Lord, I bow down and worship
Overcome by so great a love
At the foot of the Cross
I will cherish all Your mercy
All Your goodness, Your wisdom
Your power
At the foot of the Cross

Upon the Cross of Jesus
Lord, I would fix my eyes
For it always will remind me
Of these truths
My iniquity seems endless
Yet greater still Your grace
And I will glory in the Cross
Throughout the ages
For You Are Holy
O God, there's none like You
In all the earth, in all the earth
O God, who can compare
To You, to You
Only You have no beginning
Only You could make the skies
Only You are truth unending
Only You are always wise
Lord, there is none like You

For You are holy
You are holy
For You are holy
Lord You are holy

O God, there's none like you
In all the earth, in all the earth
O God, who can compare
To You, to You
Only You are never sinning
Only You have never lied
Only You cannot be tempted
Only You can never die
Lord, there is none like You
Three In One
Come now, Almighty King
Rule and reign over us
Help us Your praise to sing, Father, glorious
Embracing us before all time
You made us heirs with Christ on high
By Your Spirit now we cry
"Abba, Father"

We long for the day, Great One in Three
We finally behold Your majesty
Face to face, we'll worship and adore
Forevermore

Speak now, Incarnate Word
Of Your relentless love
Bearing our fatal curse with Your living blood
When guilt and doubt come rushing in
Help us see Your cross again
You're the Rock on which we live
Jesus, Savior

We long for the day, Great One in Three
We finally behold Your majesty
Face to face, we'll worship and adore
Forevermore

Come, Holy Comforter
Give grace to weary hearts
Bring back the wanderer, drive away the dark
You're the summer of our souls
You're the fountain of our hope
Our assurance here below
Spirit of the Son

We long for the day, Great One in Three
We finally behold Your majesty
Face to face, we'll worship and adore
Forevermore
Your Love
Your love will last forever
It's like a mighty river
That flows and flows forever
Never stopping
Your awesome love protects me
When I sin Your love corrects me
You're faithful to direct me
Always to Your love

And when I think of all You've done
There's no love greater than this
You freely gave Your precious Son
To die for all my sins

And when I choose to disobey
You lead me back to Your truth
You show the fullness of Your love
By making me like You
Sovereign One
When I'm all alone and afraid
I will trust in You
For You watch over my ways
When things in my life don't make sense
I will trust in You
For You are good, You are good

Sovereign One
You work all things to Your plan
Sovereign One
You hold all things in Your hands

When I don't get to have my own way
I will trust in You
For You know what is best
When tears begin to roll down my face
I will trust in You
For You are good, You are good

Sovereign One
You work all things to Your plan
Sovereign One
You hold all things in Your hands

Perfect in power, You control all things
Perfect in wisdom, You know everything
Perfect in goodness
Jesus, You're so good to me
So good to me

For you are Sovereign One
You work all things to Your plan
Sovereign One
You hold all things in Your hands

Sovereign One
You work all things to Your plan
Sovereign One
You hold all things in Your hands
Here Is Love
Here is love wide as the ocean
Loving kindness as a flood
When the Prince of Life, our ransom
Shed for us His precious blood
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten
Throughout Heaven's eternal days

On the mount of crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and wide
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide
Grace and love like mighty rivers
Poured incessant from above
And Heaven's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love

Oh how marvelous, oh how glorious
Is my Savior's love for me!
Oh how marvelous, oh how glorious
Is my Savior's love for me!

Of Your fullness You are pouring
Your great love on me anew
Without measure, full and boundless
Drawing out my heart to You
You alone will be my glory
Nothing in the world I see
You have cleansed and sanctified me
You Yourself have set me free
My Glorious Hope
Though waves of troubles come
And pour in like a flood
My soul will not despair
Within Your sovereign arms
No valley is too dark
To keep me from Your care
Your presence and Your promises
Are joy and life to me

Jesus, You're my glorious hope
Ever faithful to Your own
You have filled my nights
With Your sweet song of grace
Jesus You're my glorious hope
My glorious hope

When condemnations rise
When failures fill my eyes
Remind me once again
That my sufficiency
Is found upon the tree
That bought my righteousness
The depth of Your unchanging love
Displayed on Calvary

Jesus, You're my glorious hope
Ever faithful to Your own
You have filled my nights
With Your sweet song of grace
Jesus You're my glorious hope

And Jesus, every trial only proves
You are worthy of all the trust I place in You
My glorious hope

You're my glorious hope
You're my glorious hope
Jesus, You're my glorious hope
Ever faithful to Your own
You have filled my nights
With Your sweet song of grace
Jesus You're my glorious hope
My glorious hope
End
Every Tongue
Oh gather around the throne of grace
And sing His victory song
Our King rode forth to bloody war
And now He has come home
He crushed the mighty dragon
He broke his cruel reign
He broke the shackles of our sins
And freed us from our chains

Let every tongue and every tribe
Sing praises, praises
Let all creation magnify Your glorious name
Forever is not long enough
To sing of all You have done
Be praised by every tribe and every tongue

Oh look around and see the saints
All trophies of His grace
And to the Victor go the spoils
Our hearts, our lives, our praise
Take pleasure when You look on
The fruit of all Your pain
Enjoy Your glory formed in us
You suffered not in vain

Let every tongue and every tribe
Sing praises, praises
Let all creation magnify Your glorious name
Forever is not long enough
To sing of all You have done
Be praised by every tribe and every tongue

Let every tongue and every tribe
Sing praises, praises
Let all creation magnify Your glorious name
Forever is not long enough
To sing of all You have done
Be praised by every tribe and every tongue
Be praised by every tribe and every tongue
Soli Deo Gloria
We resolve to know
Nothing else but Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, and Him crucified
We resolve to know
Nothing else but Jesus Christ
The Lamb of God, and our sacrifice
To come to God by grace alone
Through faith alone in His blood, spilled for us

Singing soli Deo gloria
To God alone be glory
To God alone be glory
Singing soli Deo gloria
To God alone be glory
To God alone be glory
In Jesus Christ

We resolve to live
For nothing else but Jesus Christ
To know the One who is our life
We resolve to live
By nothing but Your Word alone
Your strength alone, for Your will alone
To make our goal to please You alone
Worship You alone, our God
And our King

Singing soli Deo gloria
To God alone be glory
To God alone be glory
Singing soli Deo gloria
To God alone be glory
To God alone be glory
In Jesus Christ
Jesus, My Only Hope
Our mouths were open graves
Full of broken vows we made
Our hearts ran wild
Our tongues could not be tamed

What darkness had concealed
Your law has now revealed
Our guilt was great
Our bitter fate was sealed

Our only hope
Our only hope is You, Lord
Our only hope
Our only hope is You

Though hypocrites and fools
You draw us to the truth
For Your own glory
You make all things new

Our only hope
Our only hope is You, Lord
Our only hope
Our only hope is You, Lord

Thes we had burned You have restored
You gave us hope when there was none before
You paid the debt that we could not afford
And cast away our guilt forevermore

So, when our days are through
Our hope will rest in You
For we can trust
Your promises are true
Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure;
Save from wrath and make me pure.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
I Will Glory In My Redeemer
I will glory in my Redeemer
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
And hung Him on that judgment tree

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who crushed the power of sin and death
My only Savior before the holy Judge
The Lamb who is my righteousness
The Lamb who is my righteousness

I will glory in my Redeemer
My life He bought, my love He owns
I have no longings for another
I'm satisfied in Him alone

I will glory in my Redeemer
His faithfulness my standing place
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me
My feet are firm, held by His grace
My feet are firm, held by His grace

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who carries me on eagles' wings
He crowns my life with lovingkindness
His triumph song I'll ever sing

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold
His face forever to behold
His face forever to behold
The Look
I saw one hanging on a tree
In agony and blood
Who fixed His loving eyes on me
As near His cross I stood
And never till my dying breath
Will I forget that look
It seemed to charge me with His death
Though not a word He spoke
My conscience felt and owned the guilt
And plunged me in despair
I saw my sins His blood had spilt
And helped to nail Him there
But with a second look He said
"I freely all forgive
This blood is for your ransom paid
I died that you might live"
Forever etched upon my mind
Is the look of Him who died
The Lamb I crucified
And now my life will sing the praise
Of pure atoning grace
That looked on me and gladly took my place
Thus while His death my sin displays
For all the world to view
Such is the mystery of grace
It seals my pardon too
With pleasing grief and mournful joy
My spirit now is filled
That I should such a life destroy
Yet live by Him I killed
Forever etched upon my mind
Is the look of Him who died
The Lamb I crucified
And now my life will sing the praise
Of pure atoning grace
That looked on me and gladly took my place
Forever etched upon my mind
Is the look of Him who died
The Lamb I crucified
And now my life will sing the praise
Of pure atoning grace
That looked on me and gladly took my place
Like a River Glorious
Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace
Over all victorious in its bright increase
Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day
Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way

Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest
Finding as He promised
Perfect peace and rest

Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care
Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there

Every joy or trial falleth from above
Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love
We may trust Him fully all for us to do
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true
Before the Throne
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heav'n He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin
Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless Righteousness
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace
One with Himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Savior and my God
With Christ my Savior and my God
The Glories of Calvary
Lord, You're calling me to come
And behold the wondrous cross
To explore the depths of grace
That came to me at such a cost
Where Your boundless love
Conquered my boundless sin
And mercy's arms were opened wide

My heart is filled with a thousand songs
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary
With every breath, Lord how I long
To sing of Jesus who died for me
Lord, take me deeper
Into the glories of Calvary

Sinners find eternal joy
In the triumph of Your wounds
By our Savior's crimson flow
Holy wrath has been removed
And Your saints below
Join with your saints above
Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb

My heart is filled with a thousand songs
Proclaiming the glories of Calvary
With every breath, Lord how I long
To sing of Jesus who died for me
Lord, take me deeper
Into the glories of Calvary
Wonderful Savior
How can we not sing out to the One who saved us
And covered us with Your blood
Casting all our sin into Your sea of mercy
Crowning us with Your love?

Wonderful Savior, beautiful Jesus
Bending down to lift us up
Out of our darkness, into Your brightness
Calling us Your own
Wonderful Savior, beautiful Jesus
We will always love You
Wonderful Savior, beautiful Jesus

How can we not sing out to the One who changed us
And gave us eternal hope
Capturing our hearts, flooding us with gladness
That someday we'll see Your face?

Calling us Your own
Wonderful Savior, beautiful Jesus
We will always love You

Out of our darkness, into Your brightness
Calling us Your own
Wonderful Savior, beautiful Jesus
We will always love You
Wonderful Savior, beautiful Jesus
Beautiful Jesus
Wonderful, wonderful...
Beautiful, beautiful...
The Glory of the Cross
Oh, to see the dawn
Of the darkest day:
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Tried by sinful men,
Torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood.

This, the pow'r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath—
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Oh, to see the pain
Written on Your face,
Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Ev'ry bitter thought,
Ev'ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow.

This, the pow'r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath—
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Now the daylight flees;
Now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
Curtain torn in two,
Dead are raised to life;
"Finished!" the vict'ry cry.

This, the pow'r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath—
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Oh, to see my name
Written in the wounds,
For through Your suffering I am free.
Death is crushed to death;
Life is mine to live,
Won through Your selfless love.

This, the pow'r of the cross:
Son of God—slain for us.
What a love! What a cost!
We stand forgiven at the cross.

This, the pow'r of the cross:
Son of God—slain for us.
What a love! What a cost!
We stand forgiven at the cross.

King of Grace
We have come to a throne of grace
Where our Mighty Savior
Perfects our praise
Where wrath and judgment
Have been put away
Where not a trace
Of all our sin remains

You're the King of Grace unending
To Your open arms we run
You're the King of Grace unending
And we rest in Your unfailing love
And we rest in Your unfailing love

We have come to a throne of grace
Where our Prince of Peace
Ever lives to pray
For those His sacrifice
Has bought and saved
Where saints and angels
Sing eternal praise
Your Great Renown
Our hearts are longing for
The glory of the Lord
To be made known in all the Earth
Lord let Your kingdom come
Lord let Your will be done
Yours is the greatest name of all

We want to see the nations bow
We want to hear the rising sound
Of the worship that You deserve
We want this passion to abound
A burden for Your great renown
Yours is the greatest name of all

Our hearts are longing for
The wisdom of the Lord
To be proclaimed in all the Earth

The dreams of any man
Yours is the greatest name of all

Our hearts are hungry for
The power of the Lord

The message of the Cross
Will bring hope to the lost
Yours is the greatest name of all
How High and How Wide
No eye has seen and no ear has heard
And no mind has ever conceived
The glorious things that You have prepared
For every one who has believed
You brought us near and You called us Your own
And made us joint heirs with Your Son

How high and how wide
How deep and how long
How sweet and how strong is Your love
How lavish Your grace
How faithful Your ways
How great is Your love, O Lord

Objects of mercy who should have known wrath
We're filled with unspeakable joy
Riches of wisdom, unsearchable wealth
And the wonder of knowing Your voice
You are our treasure and our great reward
Our hope and our glorious King
I Stand In Awe
You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words
Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom?
Who can fathom the depth of Your love?
You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty, enthroned above
And I stand, I stand in awe of You
I stand, I stand in awe of You
Holy God, to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of You
You are beautiful beyond description
Yet God crushed You for my sin
In agony and deep affliction
Cut off that I might enter in
Who can grasp such tender compassion?
Who can fathom this mercy so free?
You are beautiful beyond description
Lamb of God who died for me
And I stand, I stand in awe of You
I stand, I stand in awe of You
Holy God, to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of You
And I stand, I stand in awe of You
I stand, I stand in awe of You
Holy God, to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe
of You
Haven't You Been Good
hank You for the cross
Thank You, Lord, for drawing me
Out of millions lost
Thank You, Lord, for saving me
Haven’t You been good?
Haven’t You been so good?

Glory to Your name
Glory to Your holy name
Thankfulness and praise
For grace and mercy never changing
Haven’t You been good
Haven’t You been so good to me?

Favor on my life
Always watching over me
My darkness turned to light
And heaven’s arms enfolding me
Haven't You been good?
Haven't You been so good?

Glory to Your name
Glory to Your holy name
Thankfulness and praise
For grace and mercy never changing
Haven’t You been good
Haven’t You been so good to me?
How Firm a Foundation
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
What more can He say than to you He hath said
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled

Fear not, I am with thee; oh be not dismayed
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand

When through the deep waters I call thee to go
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress

When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie
My grace all sufficient shall be thy supply
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine

The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to its foes
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I'll never, no never, no never forsake
Everlasting
Oh God our Redeemer
Our Savior our friend
Creator of the universe
Your goodness knows no end
And our voices join
With the thousands who
Know mercy because of the Cross
All sinners washed
In Your precious blood
Forever we will sing

From everlasting to everlasting
Praise be to You
From everlasting to everlasting
Praise be to You
Oh God

Oh God our Deliverer
And Lord of all grace
How can I stand in silence
When the heavens sing Your praise
And our voices join
With the thousands who
Know mercy because of the Cross
All sinners washed
In Your precious blood
Forever we will sing
The Gospel Song (reprise)
The gospel was promised by sages and prophets
The Scriptures spoke of a Son
Descendant of David and yet uncreated
Clothed in our flesh He would come
Predestined to seek us, He took on our weakness
And died our death on the cross
But just as was spoken, the grave could not hold Him
The glorious Son of God

His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus Christ, our Lord

We're loved and forgiven, compelled by a vision
To see His mercy proclaimed
Announcing salvation to every nation
All for the sake of His name
We're no longer strangers, for Jesus, our Savior
Has come to make us His own
We're called to be holy and now we live only
To make His glory known

His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus Christ, our Lord
Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed
Alas, and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?
Was it for sins that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown
And love beyond degree
My God, why would You shed Your blood
So pure and undefiled
To make a sinful one like me
Your chosen, precious child?
Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man, the creature's, sin
Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt my eyes to tears
Before the Cross
My Savior's sacrifice paid for all my sin
So in my suffering I look to the cross again
No need, no want, no trial, no pain
Can compare to this
The wrath of God, once meant for me
Was all spent on Him

Before the Cross, I humbly bow
I place my trust in the Savior
Your finished work captures my gaze
You bore the wrath, I know the grace

In my darkest hour, Your presence is my peace
In my days of joy, Your grace carries me
Jesus, my Great High Priest
The One who pleads for me
My heart is filled with faith in You
Here at Calvary on my knees

Before the Cross, I humbly bow
I place my trust in the Savior
Your finished work captures my gaze
You bore the wrath, I know the grace

No need, no want, no trial, no pain
Can compare to this
That the wrath of God, once meant for me
Was all spent on Him

Before the Cross, I humbly bow
I place my trust in the Savior
Your finished work captures my gaze
You bore the wrath, I know the grace

Before the Cross, Lord, I humbly bow
I place my trust in the Savior
Your finished work captures my gaze
You bore the wrath, I know the grace
I Come by the Blood
You are the perfect and righteous God
Whose presence bears no sin
You bid me come to Your holy place
How can I enter in
When Your presence bears no sin?
Through Him, who poured out His life for me
The atoning Lamb of God
Through Him, and His work alone
I boldly come

I come by the blood, I come by the cross
Where Your mercy flows
From hands pierced for me
For I dare not stand on my righteousness
My every hope rests on what Christ has done
And I come by the blood

You are the high and exalted King
The One the angels fear
So far above me in every way
Lord, how can I draw near
To the One the angels fear?
Through Him who laid down His life for me
And ascended to Your side
Through Him, through Jesus alone
I boldly come
Only in the Cross
When I look upon the cross
In that spectacle of suffering
I see the power of God
There the Son of God was crushed
And lifted up to die for me
And conquered death forever

So I will glory only in the cross
Yes, I will glory only in the cross
And I will make my boast
In the Lord Jesus Christ
Crucified to ransom us

When I look upon the cross
In what might seem a senseless death
I see the wisdom of God
For there the sinless Holy One
Was made to be sin for me
Then He declared me righteous

So I will glory only in the cross
Yes, I will glory only in the cross
And I will make my boast
In the Lord Jesus Christ
Crucified to ransom us
This Fathomless Love
Lord, what moved Your heart to love lowly man
before any star could herald Your praise?
And why did You come, abasing Yourself,
veiled in a robe of frail human clay?
Why would You the pure give Your life fore the vile,
the innocent seeking the guilty to be reconciled?

I can't comprehend this fathomless love.
I'm gripped and amazed at what You have done.
Why would the adored become the despised
to bear all the furious wrath that was mine?
How awesome this mystery
of Your fathomless love for me.

Why would You adopt and take as Your own
those who had crushed Your one precious Son?
Why mercy and grace towards Your enemies?
Your name they have cursed and Your throne they have shunned.
Oh how could You choose to show kindness to these?
The ones who would mock You and hate You,
the ones just like me?
Mercies Anew
Every morning that breaks
There are mercies anew
Every breath that I take
Is your faithfulness proved
And at the end of each day
When my labors are through
I will sing of Your mercies anew

When I've fallen and strayed
There were mercies anew
For you sought me in love
And my heart you pursued
In the face of my sin
Lord, You never withdrew
So I sing of Your mercies anew

And Your mercies, they will never end
For ten thousand years they'll remain
And when this world's beauty has passed away
Your mercies will be unchanged

And when the storms swirl and rage
There are mercies anew
In affliction and pain
You will carry me through
And at the end of my days
When Your throne fills my view
I will sing of Your mercies anew
I will sing of Your mercies anew
Oh the Deep, Deep Love
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fullness over me
Underneath me, all around me
Is the current of Your love
Leading onward, leading homeward
To Your glorious rest above

Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus

Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Spread His praise from shore to shore
How He came to pay our ransom
Through the saving cross He bore
How He watches o'er His loved ones
Those He died to make His own
How for them He's interceding
Pleading now before the throne

Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus

Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Far surpassing all the rest
It's an ocean full of blessing
In the midst of every test
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Mighty Savior, precious Friend
You will bring us home to glory
Where Your love will never end

Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
The Power of the Cross (Live)
Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood

This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Oh, to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Ev'ry bitter thought, ev'ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head
Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
Finished the vict'ry cry

Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free
Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

This, the power of the cross
Son of God, slain for us
What a love, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross
We Will Glorify
We will glorify the Lamb
We will glorify the Lord of lords
Who is the great I am
Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty
We will bow before His throne
We will worship Him in righteousness
We will worship Him alone
We will glorify the King of kings
We will glorify the Lamb
We will glorify the Lord of lords
Who is the great I am
He is Lord of Heaven, Lord of Earth
He is Lord of all who live
He is Lord above the universe
All praise to Him we give
Oh, hallelujah to the King of kings
Hallelujah to the Lamb
Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords
Who is the great I am
We will glorify the King of kings
We will glorify the Lamb
We will glorify the Lord of lords
Who is the great I am
Who is the great I am
When Trials Come
When trials come no longer fear
For in the pain our God draws near
To fire a faith worth more than gold
And there His faithfulness is told
And there His faithfulness is told

Within the night I know Your peace
The breath of God brings strength to me
And new each morning mercy flows
As treasures of the darkness grow
As treasures of the darkness grow

I turn to Wisdom not my own
For every battle You have known
My confidence will rest in You
Your love endures Your ways are good
Your love endures Your ways are good

When I am weary with the cost
I see the triumph of the cross
So in it's shadow I shall run
Till He completes the work begun
Till He completes the work begun

One day all things will be made new
I'll see the hope You called me to
And in your kingdom paved with gold
I'll praise your faithfulness of old
I'll praise your faithfulness of old

I'll praise your faithfulness of old
I'll praise your faithfulness of old
I Asked the Lord That I Might Grow
I asked the Lord that I might grow
In faith and love, and ev'ry grace,
Might more of His salvation know,
And seek more earnestly His face.

'Twas He who taught me thus to pray,
And He, I trust, has answered prayer,
But it has been in such a way
As almost drove me to despair.

I hoped that in some favoured hour
At once He'd answer my request
And, by His love's constraining pow'r,
Subdue my sins, and give me rest.

Instead of this, He made me feel
The hidden evils of my heart
And let the angry pow'rs of hell
Assault my soul, in ev'ry part.

Yea, more with His own hand He seemed
Intent to aggravate my woe,
Crossed all the fair designs I schemed,
Humbled my heart, and laid me low.

"Lord, why is this," I trembling cried;
"Wilt Thou pursue Thy worm to death?"
"Tis in this way," the Lord replied,
"I answer prayer for grace and faith."

"These inward trials I employ
From self and pride to set thee free
And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me."

"And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me."
When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ, my God.
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small.
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
Jesus Paid It All
I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small.
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone.

Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat.

Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.
I Hear the Words of Love
I hear the words of love,
I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.

‘Tis everlasting peace!
Sure as Jehovah's Name;
‘Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
Forevermore the same.

The clouds may come and go
And storms may sweep my sky;
This blood-sealed friendship changes not;
The cross is ever nigh.

My love is oft-times low,
My joy still ebbs and flows;
But peace with Him remains the same;
No change Jehovah knows.

I change, He changes not,
The Christ can never die;
His love, not mine, the resting place,
His truth, not mine, the tie.
Holy, Holy, Holy
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea,
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
Who wert and art, and evermore shalt be.

Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea;
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
Speak, O Lord
Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
All Your purposes for Your glory.

Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow'r that can never fail—
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us—
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.
I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeemer Art
I greet Thee, who my sure Redeemer art,
My only Trust and Savior of my heart,
Who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;
I pray Thee, from our hearts all cares to take.

Thou art the King of mercy and of grace,
Reigning omnipotent in every place;
So come, O King, and our whole being sway;
Shine on us with the light of Thy pure day.

Thou art the life by which alone we live
And all our substance and our strength receive;
Sustain us by Thy faith and by Thy pow'r,
And give us strength in ev'ry trying hour.

Our hope is in no other save in Thee;
Our faith is built upon Thy promise free;
Lord, give us peace and make us calm and sure,
That in Thy strength we evermore endure.
Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure;
Save from wrath and make me pure.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
In Christ Alone (Live)
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when striving cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe.
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save;
Till on that cross as Jesus die,
The wrath of God was satisfied.
For every sin on Him was laid;

Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,

For I am HIs and He is mine,
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
Joy to the World (Our God Reigns)

The Gospel Song
Holy God in love became
Perfect man to bear my blame
On the cross he took my sin
By his death I live again

Holy God in love became
Perfect man to bear my blame
On the cross he took my sin
By his death I live again
All I Have Is Christ (Live)
I once was lost in darkest night
Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave
I had no hope that You would own
A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still

But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross
And I beheld God's love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace

Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life

Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
And live so all might see
The strength to follow Your commands
Could never come from me
Oh Father, use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
And let my song forever be
My only boast is You

Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life

Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
Stricken, Smitten, And Afflicted (Live)
Stricken, smitten, and afflicted
See Him dying on the tree!
‘Tis the Christ by man rejected
Yes, my soul, ‘tis He, ‘tis He!
‘Tis the long-expected Prophet
David's son, yet David's Lord
By His Son God now has spoken
‘Tis the true and faithful Word

Tell me, ye who hear Him groaning
Was there ever grief like His?
Friends through fear His cause disowning
Foes insulting His distress
Many hands were raised to wound Him
None would interpose to save
But the deepest stroke that pierced Him
Was the stroke that Justice gave

Ye who think of sin but lightly
Nor suppose the evil great
Here may view its nature rightly
Here its guilt may estimate
Mark the sacrifice appointed
See who bears the awful load
‘Tis the Word, the Lord's Anointed
Son of Man and Son of God

Here we have a firm foundation
Here the refuge of the lost
Christ, the Rock of our salvation
His the name of which we boast
Lamb of God, for sinners wounded
Sacrifice to cancel guilt!
None shall ever be confounded
Who on Him their hope have built
Arise, My Soul, Arise (Live)
Arise, my soul, arise; shake off thy guilty fears
The bleeding sacrifice in my behalf appears
Before the throne my surety stands
Before the throne my surety stands
My name is written on His hands

Five bleeding wounds He bears, received on Calvary
They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me
"Forgive him, oh forgive," they cry
"Forgive him, oh forgive," they cry
"Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"

The Father hears Him pray, His dear Anointed One
He cannot turn away the presence of His Son
His Spirit answers to the blood
His Spirit answers to the blood
And tells me I am born of God

My God is reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear
He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear
With confidence I now draw nigh
With confidence I now draw nigh
And "Father, Abba, Father" cry
Arise, My Soul, Arise (Live)
Arise, my soul, arise; shake off thy guilty fears

"Forgive him, oh forgive," they cry

Before the Throne of God Above
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea
A great high Priest whose Name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

Oh

When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin
Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless righteousness

There Is One Reason (Live)
There is one reason why we're gathered here
Your love is causing us to sing
All of Your people through Your Son draw near
Sinners before their holy King
The church of God bought by blood

We love You, Father
God of all, our God forever
We praise You, Jesus
Christ our Lord, the Son, our Savior
We're here together
In Your Holy Spirit gathered for Your glory

There's a foundation that we're building on
Rooted in Jesus Christ alone
Every believer firmly fixed upon
Our everlasting cornerstone
The church of God built by love

One Body, one baptism
One hope to which we have been called
One faith, one Lord, one Spirit
One sovereign ruler over all

We love You, Father
We praise You, Jesus
We're here together
For Your glory
His Forever - Live
Jesus, friend of sinners
Loved me 'ere I knew Him
Drew me with His cords of love
Tightly bound me to Him
'Round my heart still closely twined
The ties that none can sever
For I am His and He is mine
Forever and forever

Jesus, friend of sinners
A crown of thorns You wore for me
Bruised for my transgressions
Pierced for my iniquities
The wrath of God that I deserved
Was poured out on the Innocent
He took my place, my soul to save
Now I am His forever

Jesus, friend of sinners
I love to tell the story
Redeeming love has been my theme
And will be when in glory
Not death nor life nor anything
Can ever separate me
O love that will not let me go
Yes, I am His forever
Be Thou My Vision (Live)
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;

Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;
Thou my soul's Shelter, Thou my high Tow'r:
Raise Thou me heav'nward, O Pow'r of my pow'r.
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

High King of Heaven, my victory won,
May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heav'n's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whate'er befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
Our Great God (Live)
Eternal God, unchanging,
Mysterious and unknown;
Your boundless love, unfailing,
In grace and mercy shown.
Bright seraphim in ceaseless flight
Around Your glorious throne;
They raise their voices day
And night in praise to You alone!

Hallelujah! Glory be to our great God!
Hallelujah! Glory be to our great God!

Lord, we are weak and frail
And are helpless in the storm;
Surround us with Your angels
And hold us in Your arms.
Our cold and ruthless enemy,
His pleasure is our harm.
Rise up, O Lord, and he will flee
Before our sovereign God.

Let every creature in the sea
And every flying bird,
Let every mountain, every field,
And valley of the earth,
Let all the moons and all the stars
In all the universe
Sing praises to the living God
Who rules them by His Word.
Have Mercy on Me (Live)
I am a sinner; You're blameless, Lord
My sins against You can't be ignored
They will be punished, I know they must
Your law demands it, for You are just

Pre-If You would count
Everything that I've done wrong
Who could stand?
But there's forgiveness with You, God

Have mercy on me, have mercy on me
A broken and a contrite heart
You won't turn away
Have mercy on me, have mercy on me
Because of Your steadfast love

Father of mercy, You gave Your Son
To make atonement for wrongs I have done
What You required, Jesus fulfilled
I don't deserve it—I never will
The Glory of the Lamb
A day is coming, coming soon
When we shall see Your face
And how our hearts are yearning for
That outpouring of grace
When You take all the galaxies
And roll them up like a scroll
When You make Heaven and Earth anew
And eternity unfolds

Then the glory of the Lamb will be
All that we have longed to see
And we'll praise Your splendor
Majesty and might
There will be no darkness, be no night
We won't need the sun or moon to shine
For the glory of the Lamb will be our light

Although we see but dimly now
Our hearts are filled with love
For we have tasted and have seen
How good You are, O God
We know that our Redeemer lives
And someday You'll return
And we shall see You with our eyes
Oh how our hearts will burn

Then the glory of the Lamb will be
All that we have longed to see
And we'll praise Your splendor
Majesty and might
There will be no darkness, be no night
We won't need the sun or moon to shine
For the glory of the Lamb will be our light
All Glory Be to Christ (Live)
Should nothing of our efforts stand
No legacy survive
Unless the Lord does raise the house
In vain its builders striveTo you who boast tomorrow's gain
Tell me what is your life
A mist that vanishes at dawn
All glory be to Christ!

All glory be to Christ our king!
All glory be to Christ!
His rule and reign will ever sing,
All glory be to Christ!

His will be done
His kingdom come
On earth as is above
Who is Himself our daily bread
Praise Him the Lord of love

Let living water satisfy
The thirsty without price
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
All glory be to Christ!

All glory be to Christ our king!
All glory be to Christ!
His rule and reign will ever sing,
All glory be to Christ!

When on the day the great I Am
The faithful and the true
The Lamb who was for sinners slain
Is making all things new.

Behold our God shall live with us
And be our steadfast light
And we shall ere his people be
All glory be to Christ!
My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less (Live)
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
When darkness hides His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less (Live)
My hope is built on nothing less

I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
When darkness hides His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
The Unbelievable
Come and see
the inconceivable
and believe the unbelievable
God has come to dwell with us

Begotten Son
born into adam's earth
promised one
fulfilling ancient words
God has come to dwell with us

Who could ever know the depths of the mystery of your grace
though I can't take it in,
Lord our hearts are filled with praise

He will heal
the unhealable
He will save
the unsavable
God has come to dwell with us
Heaven's joy
will drink our bitter cup
emptied out
as he is lifted up
God has come to dwell with us
who could ever know the depths of the mystery of your grace
though our minds can't take it in,
Lord our hearts are filled with praise.

Lord we're lost
and overwhelmed at the thought of such amazing love
God has come
God has come
God has come to dwell with us
There Blooms a Rose in Bethlehem
there blooms a rose in Bethlehem
from tender stem hath sprung
of Jesse's line this folwer grows
As men of old have sung
Isaiah told us long ago
About this rose we'd find
in virgin arms we shall behold
the savior of mankind

the glories of the heavens
surrounded shepherds bright
the angels sang, a sign was shown
the Christ was born at night
what mystery they came upon
the sign the heralds laud
in manger slept the Holy One
in flesh the Son of God

this flow'r in bloom, a scent so sweet
that greet us in the air
it has dispelled with hopefulness
the sting of death's despair
foretold, this rose was born to die
but would not see decay
so those who place their faith in Him
shall blossom from the grace
A God Who Saves
Even when we were weak, despairing and broken
You did not give us to our hearts' desires
You came as You promised, a rescue for sinners
You conquered death by giving up Your life

PRE-At the right time
You died for the ungodly
At the right time
You showed Your love for us

Our God is a God Who saves
Our God is a God Who saves
Our hearts are filled with wonder
Our mouths are filled with praise
Our God is a God Who saves

If we've been reconciled while we were still rebels
How much more has God made us His own?
In mercy He gave us a hope and a future
Beyond this mortal life of flesh and bone
Our Only Hope Is You
Our mouths were open graves
Full of broken vows we made
Our hearts ran wild
Our tongues could not be tamed

What darkness had concealed
Your law has now revealed
Our guilt was great
Our bitter fate was sealed

Our only hope
Our only hope is You, Lord
Our only hope
Our only hope is You

Though hypocrites and fools
You draw us to the truth
For Your own glory
You make all things new

Our only hope
Our only hope is You, Lord
Our only hope
Our only hope is You, Lord

You gave us hope when there was none before
You paid the debt that we could not afford
And cast away our guilt forevermore

So, when our days are through
Our hope will rest in You
For we can trust
Your promises are true
Judge of the Secrets
O holy Judge, here is my heart
What can I say to You?
Where could I run, how could I hide?
Darkness is day to You
The heart of a man is a maze within
So, come, light the way, illuminate sin
Nothing's concealed, all is revealed
Jesus, I yield to You

Judge of the secrets
Of the hearts of men
Here I surrender
And humbly repent
You've conquered my soul
Now be its defense
Judge of the secrets
Of the hearts of men

I was condemned under Your law
Rightly I stood accused
I felt my need, my conscience agreed
I was without excuse
So how can I judge the ones who fall?
I know in my heart I'm just like them all
I will confess: my righteousness
Jesus, must rest in You

O holy Judge, here is my heart
What can I say to You?
I will not run, I will not hide
I know I'm safe with You
Almighty Maker
Who but the Lord set the bound'ries of light
Hung the stars in the night?
Who but the Lord drew the face on the moon
Made the planets to move?
Who but the Lord tells the clouds when to pour
Thunder to roar?
Amazing are Your works

Almighty Maker
You command heaven and earth
By the power of Your Word
Be praised forever
Almighty Maker
All creation sings of You
Glory fills all that You do
Be praised forever, ever, evermore

Who but the Lord could have dreamed of the plan
That would save fallen man?
Who but the Lord washes rebels with blood
Making mercy a flood?
Who but the Lord could give life through a cross
Rescuing us?
Amazing are Your ways

All things are from You
All things are through You
O God, the great I AM
All things are for You
All things are to You
O God, the great I AM
Grace and Peace
Grace and peace, oh how can this be
For lawbreakers and thieves
For the worthless, the least
You have said, that our judgment is death
For all eternity
Without hope, without rest
Oh, what an amazing mystery
What an amazing mystery
That Your grace has come to me

Grace and peace, oh how can this be
The matchless King of all
Paid the blood price for me
Slaughtered lamb, what atonement You bring!
The vilest sinner's heart
Can be cleansed, can be free
Oh, what an amazing mystery
What an amazing mystery
That Your grace has come to me

Grace and peace, oh how can this be
Let songs of gratefulness
Ever rise, never cease
Loved by God and called as a saint
My heart is satisfied
In the riches of Christ
Oh, what an amazing mystery
What an amazing mystery
That Your grace has come to me

Oh, what an amazing love I see
What an amazing love I see
That Your grace has come to me
Oh, what an amazing love I see
What an amazing love I see
That Your grace has come to me
The Gospel Was Promised
The gospel was promised by sages and prophets
The Scriptures spoke of a Son
Descendant of David, and yet uncreated
Clothed in our flesh He would come
Predestined to seek us
He took on our weakness
And died our death on the cross
But just as was spoken,
The grave could not hold Him
The glorious Son of God

His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus Christ, our Lord

We're loved and forgiven, compelled by a vision
To see His mercy proclaimed
Announcing salvation to every nation
All for the sake of His name
We're no longer strangers
For Jesus, our Savior
Has come to make us His own
We're called to be holy
And now we live only
To make His glory known

His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus Christ, our Lord
Because You First Loved Me
Love is patient, love is kind
Everywhere and every time
It gives its place in line
To serve another
But my heart it struggles so
I need Your grace to grow
Lord, help me give and show
This love to others
Jesus, set me free to love unselfishly

Because You first loved me
I can love You
With all my heart
Because You first loved me
I'll love others too
The way You do
I'll love them too

When I love, it looks like this:
It always gives and gives
To God and then it lives
To help my neighbor
That's a love I haven't got
It's me I love a lot
Stuck here I'm tied in knots
I need a Savior
Jesus, set me free to love
You more than me

Because You first loved me
I can love You
With all my heart
Because You first loved me
I'll love others too
The way You do
I'll love them too

Because You first loved me
I can love You
With all my heart
Because You first loved me
I'll love others too
The way You do
I'll love them too
To Be Like Jesus
Love, joy, peace, and patience too
Grow in those who trust in You
All who put their hope in Christ
Kindness, goodness, faithfulness
Self-control and gentleness
Live in those who have new life

I want to be like Jesus
To walk and talk like Jesus
I want to live like one who follows Him
I want to love like Jesus
To give my all like Jesus
I want to live like one who follows Him

I don't always do what's right
Jesus lived a perfect life
And for sins like mine He died
Teach me to obey Your Word
Help me to put others first
Holy Spirit, change my life
Make Me Wise
Shades from the past are chasing my life
The world we built together is crumbling down
I'm so sick of being the sailor
When the ship we are sailing is sinking down

You, you blamed me all the time, asking for more
But what I got back? Nothing! Nothing!
And all the fears I had are getting so real
And all the secrets you kept are falling to pieces

Do you remember when we used to shine like diamonds?
When everything around us was just a fucking fairy tale
That time has gone so far away and I'm still dying in my memories
While you just left me with a spit on my face

Every teardrop has become blood
You fucking cunt get on your dirty disgusting
Knees

And I won't be ashamed
To watch myself in the mirror
Cause I will never live my life behind a mask

Time is running out
I'm taking back my life
Cause I wanna come back to shine

I won't forget your promise
You were supposed to save me
And I've been trying to bear all that you did
What you believed in
I won't regret my choices
I was supposed to grow old with you
But you denied my life and what I did
What I believed in

I've no remorses
You've just regrets
They're gonna chase you
Until you'll dig your own grave

I sewed my fucking eyes
The darkness shows me all the secrets you hide
Now just look yourself in the mirror
The ghost you keep inside will never die

Time is running out
I'm taking back my life
Cause I wanna come back to shine

I won't forget your promise
You were supposed to save me
And I've been trying to bear all that you did
What you believed in
I won't regret my choices
I was supposed to grow old with you
But you denied my life and what I did
What I believed in
Trust In the Lord
My father said, "Don't forget my teaching
But hold on tight to my commands
For long life and peace they will add to you
Don't let love and kindness leave you
Write them down upon your heart
And God and people will smile on you"

Trust in the Lord with all your heart
And do not lean on your own understanding
In all your ways acknowledge Him
And He'll make straight all your paths
Trust in the Lord

My father said, "Don't be wise in your eyes
But fear the Lord and turn from sin
And God will heal you and give you strength"
Look to Jesus to be your treasure
He's worth more than jewels and gold
For He's more precious than anything

Jesus, You're my confidence, Jesus, You're my hope
You will keep my feet from stumbling
Jesus, You're my confidence, Jesus, You're my hope
You will keep my feet from stumbling

I'll trust in the Lord with all my heart
And will not lean on my own understanding
In all my ways I'll acknowledge Him
And He'll make straight all my paths
Trust in the Lord
It Is Not Death to Die
It is not death to die
To leave this weary road
And join the saints who dwell on high
Who've found their home with God
It is not death to close
The eyes long dimmed by tears
And wake in joy before Your throne
Delivered from our fears
O Jesus, conquering the grave
Your precious blood has power to save
Those who trust in You
Will in Your mercy find
That it is not death to die
It is not death to fling
Aside this earthly dust
And rise with strong and noble wing
To live among the just
It is not death to hear
The key unlock the door
That sets us free from mortal years
To praise You evermore
O Jesus, conquering the grave
Your precious blood has power to save
Those who trust in You
Will in Your mercy find
That it is not death to die
I Have a Shelter
We do not have the lyrics for I Have a Shelter yet.
Glorious
How great You are
Your greatness none can fathom
Upholding all
By Your almighty Word
The universe
Fulfills Your every purpose
And all You've made
Will bring You praise, O God

You are glorious, glorious
And we will lift our voices to worship You
You are glorious, glorious
And we will always be in awe of You

You move the stars
The planets in their courses
The clouds and wind
And everything that moves
You hold my life
You take my joys and sorrows
And cause them all
To bring glory to You

Your ways are high
Too deep for man to fathom
But You are good
And this will be my theme
You sent Your Son
To live and die for sinners
So I will trust
And hope in You, my King
Joy in My Morning
When darkness falls
Temptations call
And all around me seems undone
You hear my pleas
Supply my needs
And tell me of Your wondrous love

You are the joy in my morning
You're my song of praise
Just like the new day dawning
Flooding my world with grace

Though trials come
And every one
Can take me further from Your truth
You calm my fears
Dry all my tears
And draw me closer, Lord, to You

In You there's no shadow of turning
Constant in all Your ways
You're growing my faith
And I'm learning to lean
On You all of my days
Our Hope Is Alive
Hope that is seen is no hope at all
Our hope is in what is to come
Christ coming again to bring us to heav'n
A glorious end to our fall
The trials we face will fade
When all our tears are washed away

Rejoice!
Our hope is alive
Alive in Him, the Son is risen
Rejoice!
One day we'll arise
From death to life, our hope is alive in Christ

Hope isn't found in things we possess
Nor found in the praises of men
Our will to survive won't bring us new life
We look past this world to the next
Coming on the clouds
We'll see the King and all will bow

Rejoice! Our hope is alive in Christ
Rejoice! Our hope is alive in Christ
Rejoice! Our hope is alive
Rejoice! Our hope is alive
Rejoice! Our hope is alive in Christ

Glory Awaits
Blood-bought children who are suff'ring
It won't be long, It won't be long
Storm-tossed pilgrim, if you're struggling
It won't be long, It won't be long
Though your flesh is now decaying
It won't be long, It won't be long
A new body God is making
It won't be long, It won't be long
Glory awaits
For all God's redeemed
Glory awaits
And we'll be free

All you saints now bound in prison
It won't be long, It won't be long
Here's your freedom: Christ is risen
It won't be long, It won't be long
Glory awaits
For all God's redeemed
Glory awaits
And we'll be free

We are longing for Christ's appearing
It won't be long, It won't be long
Tears will vanish when we see Him
It won't be long, It won't be long
Glory awaits
For all God's redeemed
Glory awaits
And we'll be free
Nothing in All the Earth
What shall separate us from Your love?
Can years of sorrow break eternal bonds?
Can condemnation ever raise its voice
Against the pardon of the blood of Christ?
Though our journey here is long
This will be our triumph song
Nothing in all the earth
Not any height above
Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
Nothing in all the earth
Not any height above
Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
What shall separate us from Your love?
For now the sting of death is overcome
And all the powers of this world must fall
Before Your feet because You rule them all
And though our journey here is long
This shall be our triumph song
Nothing in all the earth
Not any height above
Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
Nothing in all the earth
Not any height above
Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
Nothing in all the earth
Could ever tear us from
Your everlasting love
O Holy Night (Hear the Gospel Story)
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
Humbly He lay, Creator come as creature,
Born on the floor of a hay-scattered stall.
True Son of God, yet bearing human feature,
He entered earth to reverse Adam's fall.
In towering grace, He laid aside His glory,
And in our place, was sacrificed for sin.
Fall on your knees! O hear the gospel story!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
Come then to Him Who lies within the manger,
With joyful shepherds, proclaim Him as Lord.
Let not the Promised Son remain a stranger;
In reverent worship, make Christ your Adored.
Eternal life is theirs who would receive Him;
With grace and peace, their lives He will adorn.
Fall on your knees! Receive the Gift of heaven!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night when Christ was born
Who Would Have Dreamed
On a starlit hillside, shepherds watched their sheep
Slowly, David's city drifted off to sleep
But to this little town of no great renown
The Lord had a promise to keep
Prophets had foretold it, a mighty King would come
Long-awaited Ruler, God's anointed one
But the Sovereign of all looked helpless and small
As God gave the world His own Son
And who would have dreamed or ever foreseen
That we could hold God in our hands?
The Giver of Life is born in the night
Revealing God's glorious plan
To save the world
Wondrous gift of heaven: the Father sends the Son
Planned from time eternal, moved by holy love
He will carry our curse and death He'll reverse
So we can be daughters and sons
Before the Skies
Before the skies were stretched abroad
From everlasting was the Word
God was He; the Word was God
And He must be adored
By the Word all came to be
The universe and all contained
Showing God's authority
His power and His reign

Glory, glory
Glory in the highest
Glory, glory
Glory God is with us
With us

Though His glories still proceed
Never changing from our Lord
He laid down His majesty
And took on human form
Mortals here beheld His face
The Heav'nly Father's perfect Son
Full of truth and full of grace
The Savior now has come!

He gave up His life in love
So our lips could gladly tell
Christ, the Word, has come to us
Our Lord, Immanuel
One Still Night
One still night, Mary awoke
Stirred by an angel, she trembled as he spoke
One small child would soon be born
The King of kings will wear a crown of thorns

"Glory to God," the angels sang
"Immanuel was born for you this day
Peace on earth, good will toward men
Immanuel has come to Bethlehem
Immanuel has come to Bethlehem"

One still night, while Joseph dreamed
He saw a vision within his troubled sleep
One small child, his bride would give
Deliverer delivered to save us from our sin

And to His kingdom there'll be no end
And to His kingdom there'll be no end
And to His kingdom there'll be no end

One still night, a light was shown
That all the darkness could never overcome
O Come, O Come, Emmanuel
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

O come, Thou, Dayspring from on high
And cause Thy light on us to rise
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadow put to flight
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

O come, O come, true prophet of the Lord
And turn the key to heaven's door
Be Thou our comforter and guide
And lead us to the Father's side
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall by His word our darkness dispel

O come, our great High Priest, and intercede
Thy sacrifice, our only plea
The judgment we no longer fear
Thy precious blood has brought us near
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Has banished every fear of hell

O Come, Thou King of nations bring
An end to all our suffering
Bid every pain and sorrow cease
And reign now as our Prince of Peace
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come again with us to dwell
God Made Low
Prophets promised long ago
A King would come to bring us hope
And now a virgin bears a son
The time to save the world has come

Humble shepherds run in haste
To see the One the angels praised
In cattle stall they find a girl
Who holds the hope of all the world

Emmanuel has come to us
The Christ is born, Hallelujah!
Our God made low to raise us up
Emmanuel, has come to us

As He sleeps upon the hay
He holds the moon and stars in place
Though born an infant He remains
The sovereign God of endless days

For all our sins one day He'll die
To make us sons of God on high
Let every heart prepare Him room
The promises have all come true
What Child Is This
What Child is this Who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and lamb are feeding?
Good Christian, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
The cross be borne for me, for you
Hail, hail the Word made flesh
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise a song on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary
He Who Is Mighty
Oh, the mercy our God has shown
To those who sit in death's shadow
The sun on high pierced the night
Born was the Cornerstone
Unto us a Son is given, unto us a Child is born
He Who is mighty has done a great thing
Taken on flesh, conquered death's sting
Shattered the darkness and lifted our shame
Holy is His name
Oh, the freedom our Savior won
The yoke of sin has been broken
Once a slave, now by grace
No more condemnation
Unto us a Son is given, unto us a Child is born
He Who is mighty has done a great thing
Taken on flesh, conquered death's sting
Shattered the darkness and lifted our shame
Holy is His name
Holy is His name
Now my soul magnifies the Lord
I rejoice in the God Who saves
I will trust His unfailing love
I will sing His praises all my days
Now my soul magnifies the Lord
I rejoice in the God Who saves
I will trust His unfailing love
I will sing His praises all my days
He Who is mighty has done a great thing
Taken on flesh, conquered death's sting
Shattered the darkness and lifted our shame
Holy is His name
Holy is His name
Come All Ye Faithful
Come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
Oh Come ye, oh come ye, to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the king of angels
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us
Adore Him
Christ, the Lord

Yea Lord we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us
Adore Him
Christ, the Lord

True God oh true God
Life from light eternal
Humbly he enters the virgin's womb
Son of the Father,
Begotten, not created

Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us
Adore Him
Christ, the Lord
It Is Not Death To Die (Split Trax)
It is not death to die
To leave this weary road
And join the saints who dwell on high
Who've found their home with God
It is not death to close
The eyes long dimmed by tears
And wake in joy before Your throne
Delivered from our fears

O Jesus, conquering the grave
Your precious blood has power to save
Those who trust in You
Will in Your mercy find
That it is not death to die

It is not death to fling
Aside this earthly dust
And rise with strong and noble wing
To live among the just
It is not death to hear
The key unlock the door
That sets us free from mortal years
To praise You evermore
Hide Away In the Love of Jesus (Split Trax)
Come, weary saints, though tired and weak
Hide away in the love of Jesus
Your strength will return by His quiet streams
Hide away in the love of Jesus

Come, wandering souls, and find your home
Hide away in the love of Jesus
He offers the rest that you yearn to know
Hide away in the love of Jesus

Hear Him calling your name
See the depths of His love
In the wounds of His grace
Hide away

Come, guilty ones weighed down with sin
Hide away in the love of Jesus
The freedom you long for is found in Him
Hide away in the love of Jesus

Come, hopeless hearts, do not despair
Hide away in the love of Jesus
For ten thousand joys await you there
Hide away in the love of Jesus
My Life Is an Offering
This life is an altar
Where I want to offer
My soul, and my mind, and strength
Cleansed by Your mercy to live a life worthy
Of the One Who called my name

Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Let me be a pleasing sacrifice
Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Here on the altar
My life is an offering

How could I not love You?
You authored my rescue
Raised me up from death to life
Your Spirit is in me, revealing Your glory
Oh what joy as I give my life

Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Let me be a pleasing sacrifice
Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Here on the altar
My life is an offering

I choose to lose my life, Lord And find it in You Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Let me be a pleasing sacrifice
Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Here on the altar
My life is an offering
It's Your Grace
You will save whom You will save
We're the lost and helpless ones
The rebels and the renegades
Who spurned Your holy love
You will save whom You will save
Mercy will be magnified
Everyone has gone astray
And followed after lies
But You have loved us and opened our eyes

It's Your grace
From beginning to the end
It's Your grace
We will never comprehend
Why You drew the ones who ran from You
What can we do but offer You praise?

You will save whom You will save
We were captive to our wills
And if our hearts had not been changed
We'd flee Your mercy still
You will save whom You will save
Who can question what You do?
You're the potter, we're the clay
You can make us as You choose
And there is no one who boasts before You

You will save whom You will save
Yet the promised hope remains
You will rescue anyone
Who calls upon Your name
You will save whom You will save
Faithful love won't be denied
Christ has overcome the grave
And for our sins He died
And when He comes back His glory will shine
All Glory Be Forever
We had turned from God to sin's disgrace
We chose the path to hell
Perfect law of God condemned our race
For all in Adam fell
But the righteousness of God appeared
And the world found hope again
For the Righteous One has come down to bear
All the curse of sin and death

Now to Him Who's seated on the throne
All glory be forever
Oh, the depths of wisdom, grace, and power
All glory be forever
All glory be forever

Every bond of sin that held us fast
Is left in Jesus' grave
We've been freed from all that gripped our past
From Satan's rule and reign
We've been raised to life to breathe again
As captives now reclaimed
All our guilt is gone, all our striving ceased
We're alive to seek His fame

Now to Him Who's seated on the throne
All glory be forever
Oh, the depths of wisdom, grace, and power
All glory be forever
All glory be forever

Now our future's fixed, our journey clear
God will not let us go
Every trial that tempts our hearts to fear
He'll use to give us hope
All creation groans as we await
What our eyes have longed to see
Every pain and evil we've long endured
Will be crushed by Christ our King

Now to Him Who's seated on the throne
All glory be forever
Oh, the depths of wisdom, grace, and power
All glory be forever
All glory be forever
Through the Precious Blood
You have ordained every breath we take
In pleasure or pain, there is no mistake
Gladness and grief, both are in Your hand
And sufferings brief carry out Your plan
And our fleeting sorrows
Will yield an endless prize
When some bright tomorrow
We'll see You with our eyes, and

Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Through the precious blood of Christ

Father of lights, Giver of all grace
Your mercies crown our lives all our days
River of Life, quench our thirsty souls
For no true delight does Your love withhold
And in every season
We are satisfied
For just one reason
Christ was crucified, and
Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Through the precious blood of Christ
All good gifts, every good thing
Comes to us freely, so freely
All good gifts, every good thing
Comes to us freely, so freely
Through the precious blood
Through the precious blood
Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Through the precious blood of Christ
Totally God, Totally Man
Jesus, He's fully God and fully man
That's really hard to understand
So, let me try to explain

Jesus, His Word upholds the galaxies
But He babbled like a baby
In His mother's arms
Jesus understands the universe
But He had to go to school to learn
How to write His name

Jesus walked upon the ocean blue
But His feet got tired and dirty too
On the dusty roads
Jesus cried when His friend Lazarus died
But His power brought Him back to life
When He called his name

He's totally God (totally God) and totally man (totally man)
Both in One (both in One), He's the great I AM (the great I AM)
To save the world (to save the world), fulfill God's plan (fulfill God's plan)
He had to be totally God, totally man

Jesus obeyed His Father perfectly
And we know that's something you and me
Couldn't ever do
No, no, no
Jesus died to pay for all our sins
Rose to save the ones who trust in Him
For eternity

He's totally God (totally God) and totally man (totally man)
Both in One (both in One), He's the great I AM (the great I AM)
To save the world (to save the world), fulfill God's plan (fulfill God's plan)
He had to be totally God, totally man

He's totally God (totally God), totally man (totally man)
Both in One (both in One), He's the great I AM (the great I AM)
To save the world (to save the world), fulfill God's plan (fulfill God's plan)
He had to be totally God, totally man
Totally God, totally man
The Gospel Song - Live
Holy God in love became
Perfect man to bear my blame
On the cross he took my sin
By his death I live again

Holy God in love became
Perfect man to bear my blame
On the cross he took my sin
By his death I live again
Holy, Holy, Holy - Live
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea,
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
Who wert and art, and evermore shalt be.

Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea;
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
Behold Our God - Live
Who has held the oceans in His hands
Who has numbered every grain of sand
Kings and nations tremble at His voice
All creation rises to rejoice

Behold our God seated on His throne
Come let us adore Him
Behold our King nothing can compare
Come let us adore Him!

Who has given counsel to the Lord
Who can question any of His Words
Who can teach the One who knows all things
Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds

Who has felt the nails upon His hands
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
God eternal humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior risen now to reign!

Men: You will reign forever!
Women: Let Your glory fill the earth
Speak, O Lord - Live
Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
All Your purposes for Your glory.

Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow'r that can never fail—
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us—
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.
I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeemer Art - Live
I greet Thee, who my sure Redeemer art,
My only Trust and Savior of my heart,
Who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;
I pray Thee, from our hearts all cares to take.

Thou art the King of mercy and of grace,
Reigning omnipotent in every place;
So come, O King, and our whole being sway;
Shine on us with the light of Thy pure day.

Thou art the life by which alone we live
And all our substance and our strength receive;
Sustain us by Thy faith and by Thy pow'r,
And give us strength in ev'ry trying hour.

Our hope is in no other save in Thee;
Our faith is built upon Thy promise free;
Lord, give us peace and make us calm and sure,
That in Thy strength we evermore endure.
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty - Live
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear, now to His temple draw near,
Join me in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen how thy desires e'er have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee!
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee;
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do
If with His love He befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
Let the amen sound from His people again;
Gladly forever adore Him.
Now Why This Fear (Live)
Now why this fear and unbelief?
Has not the Father put to grief,
His spotless Son for us?
And will the righteous Judge of men
Condemn me for that debt of sin
Now canceled at the cross?

Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
Jesus, You've rescued us
Through Your great love

Complete atonement You have made
And by Your death have fully paid
The debt Your people owed
No wrath remains for us to face
We're sheltered by Your saving grace
And sprinkled with Your blood

How sweet the sound of saving grace
How sweet the sound of saving grace
Christ died for me

Be still my soul and know this peace
The merits of your great high priest
Have bought your liberty
Rely then on His precious blood
Don't fear your banishment from God
Since Jesus sets you free

Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
Jesus, You've rescued us
Through Your great love

How sweet the sound of saving grace
How sweet the sound of saving grace
Christ died for me
How sweet the sound of saving grace
How sweet the sound of saving grace
Christ died for me

Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
Jesus, You've rescued us
Through Your great love
Greater Than We Can Imagine (Live)
Every day we'll bless You and praise Your name
And on Your glorious splendor we will dwell
On Your wondrous works, Lord, we'll meditate
And of Your awesome power we will tell
We'll speak of Your salvation and Your abundant goodness

Because You are greater than we can imagine
You are too beautiful for us to fathom
Oh, You are great, and greatly to be praised

Every generation shall sing Your worth
And magnify Your mercy and Your grace
We'll sing about the Savior who came to earth
To bear the sins of those He came to save
You fill our hearts with wonder
We'll worship You forever
All I Have Is Christ
I once was lost in darkest night
Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave
I had no hope that You would own
A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still
But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross
And I beheld God's love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace
Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
And live so all might see
The strength to follow Your commands
Could never come from me
Oh Father, use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
And let my song forever be
My only boast is You
Come Praise and Glorify
Come praise and glorify our God
The Father of our Lord
In Christ He has in heav'nly realms
His blessings on us poured
For pure and blameless in His sight
He destined us to be
And now we've been adopted through
His Son eternally

To the praise of Your glory
To the praise of Your mercy and grace
To the praise of Your glory
You are the God who saves

Come praise and glorify our God
Who gives His grace in Christ
In Him our sins are washed away
Redeemed through sacrifice
In Him God has made known to us
The myst'ry of His will
That Christ should be the head of all
His purpose to fulfill

To the praise of Your glory
To the praise of Your mercy and grace
To the praise of Your glory
You are the God who saves

Come praise and glorify our God
For we've believed the Word
And through our faith we have a seal
The Spirit of the Lord
The Spirit guarantees our hope
Until redemption's done
Until we join in endless praise
To God, the Three in One

To the praise of Your glory
To the praise of Your mercy and grace
To the praise of Your glory
You are the God who saves

To the praise of Your glory
To the praise of Your mercy and grace
To the praise of Your glory
You are the God who saves
Hallowed Be Your Name

Who is like You, Father

The Source of life and love?

An overflowing fountain

In Spirit and the Son

Abba! Our Father

Hallowed be Your name

Reigning high in heaven

Receive our grateful praise


Who is like You, Jesus

The Son most glorious?

The fullness of the Godhead

Who came in flesh for us

Savior, Lord Jesus

Hallowed be Your name

Risen now in power

The Lamb for sinners slain


Who is like You, Spirit

Our Comfort from above?

You draw us to the Savior

Reveal the Father’s love

Spirit, O Spirit

Hallowed be Your name

Fount of living water

Come, fill our hearts again


God, there’s no one like You

For who can bear the sight?

Clothed in glorious splendor

In holy, burning light

O God, our God

Who was and is to come

Father, Son, and Spirit

Most holy Three-in-One
We Are Not Ashamed

We, we are not ashamed

For the gospel is the power of God to save

Yes, we, we are not ashamed

For we have no other Savior to proclaim

Christ alone, the Life, the Truth, the Way


The news of Jesus Christ, the crucified

Risen, reigning at the Father’s side

Is foolishness to those who cannot see

Blinded by the lies they have believed


So, let the Church arise, let the anthem ring

Till all the world has heard of Christ the Risen King

The song of the redeemed boldly we shall sing

The hope of all the world is Christ the Risen King!


The enemies of God are in a rage

Opposing Him, their efforts are in vain

Through every age the gospel will endure

The Spirit’s with the Church forevermore


We, we are not ashamed

For we have a sure foundation in His grace

Yes, we, we are not ashamed

For we have a great salvation in His name

Christ alone, the Life, the Truth, the Way
Lamb of God

Hail the perfect Lamb of God

A kingly ransom paid

When You, my Lord, were slain

Love unrivaled here displayed

Calls my heart to praise

The perfect Lamb of God


The light of day was cloaked by night

And heaven closed its eyes

Wrath unspared for countless sins

The guiltless crucified

Hands of kindness driven through

Back on splintered beam

The holy curtain torn in two

Atonement made for me


Insults mock the Son of God

The angels are restrained

But all the cup must be endured

For sinners to be saved

Can grace prevail in such a day

Of scandal and of scorn?

But with a cry “Forgive” You claim

Traitors as Your own


As You drew Your final breath

My debt was satisfied

And love divine in glorious might

Would vanquish death and rise
Great One in Three

Come now, Almighty King, rule and reign over us

Help us Your praise to sing, Father, glorious

Embracing us before all time

You made us heirs with Christ on high

By Your Spirit now we cry

“Abba, Father”


We long for the day, Great One in Three

We finally behold Your majesty

Face to face, we’ll worship and adore

Forevermore


Speak now, Incarnate Word, of Your relentless love

Bearing our fatal curse with Your living blood

When guilt and doubt come rushing in

Help us see Your cross again

You’re the Rock on which we live

Jesus, Savior


Come, Holy Comforter, give grace to weary hearts

Bring back the wanderer, drive away the dark

You’re the summer of our souls

You’re the fountain of our hope

Our assurance here below

Spirit of the Son
Grace Greater Than All Our Sin - Live
Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt

Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide;
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe,
All who are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?
I Hear the Words of Love - Live
I hear the words of love,
I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.

‘Tis everlasting peace!
Sure as Jehovah's Name;
‘Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
Forevermore the same.

The clouds may come and go
And storms may sweep my sky;
This blood-sealed friendship changes not;
The cross is ever nigh.

My love is oft-times low,
My joy still ebbs and flows;
But peace with Him remains the same;
No change Jehovah knows.

I change, He changes not,
The Christ can never die;
His love, not mine, the resting place,
His truth, not mine, the tie.

Jesus Paid It All - Live
I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small.
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone.

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat.

God Always Keeps His Promises
Oh, God He always keeps His promises
He said the sons of Abraham would be more than the grains of sand
And so, his family grew underneath the Pharaoh's rule
Oh, God He always keeps His promises
He said the blood upon the door would keep the Israelites secure
And so, He stayed His hand and led them to the Promised Land
Our God is good and true; He cannot lie to me and you
We can be sure of this: God always keeps His promises
Oh, God He always keeps His promises
He gave us laws to be obeyed and we broke every one He made
But when we ran from Him, God said He'd take care of our sin
Our God is good and true; He cannot lie to me and you
We can be sure of this: God always keeps His promises
Oh, God He always keeps His promises
He said His Son would set us free through His death at Calvary
He suffered in our place, and then He rose up from the grave
Our God is good and true; He cannot lie to me and you
We can be sure of this: God always keeps His promises
Grace Greater Than All Our Sin
Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt

Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide;
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe,
All who are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?

Praise to the Lord, The Almighty
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear, now to His temple draw near;
Praise Him in glad adoration.
Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen how thy desires e'er have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?
Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee;
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do,
If with His love He befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, oh, let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him;
Let the Amen sound from His people again,
Gladly for aye we adore Him.
Time Keeps Slippin' Away
Time keeps slippin' away
And I've been longing for my home
With every glimpse of heaven
I am holding onto hope
Lord, to be with You

Is better than this life

Hurry up the day

When my faith shall be sight

How I yearn to be
Free from these chains

Shed my skin and rise
Join the angels in their praise
In light of grace death

Has lost its fearful sing
To die is gain
For I'll be with my King

O my soul, lift your eyes
Hope will come, He is Christ
Then in triumph we'll rise with Him
How long?
Will You come, will You come, will You come

My head in the clouds
Though my feet upon the dirt
My heart in Your hands
Though my body still on earth
If I were a bird I would
Spread my wings and fly
Leave the world behind
Aim for heaven, say goodbye
Oh, to See You
Christ the King of every age
Enthroned in light 'ere worlds were made
Come in mortal flesh divine
Into our dark came heaven's light

Hanging on the cross of shame
I see the wounds my hands have made
"Forgive them Father," now He cries
And with a breath my Savior dies

Oh, to see You, Jesus, I can hardly wait
To behold Your wounds of grace
To express my love
And thank You face to face
My heart is Yours; for You I long

Look into His empty grave
The bonds of death could not constrain
Sin and fear and death are dead
For Christ arose and crushed their head

Oh, to see You, Jesus, I can hardly wait
To behold Your wounds of grace
To express my love
And thank You face to face
My heart is Yours; for You I long

Coming soon to claim His Bride
All the redeemed He'll purify
We'll need no sun or moon to shine
For Christ the Lamb will be our light!

Oh, to see You, Jesus, I can hardly wait
To behold Your wounds of grace
To express my love
And thank You face to face
My heart is Yours; for You I long
Plead for Me
When I am weak I lift up my eyes
To see my Savior plead for me
When fear closes in and doubt sows a seed
I know my Savior pleads for me

Of Your love there is no doubt
Of Your mercies I am sure
Jesus knows my need and for me intercedes
All my hope is Christ

When sins rise up I fall to my knees
To see my Savior plead for me
Storms may rage on, but this is my peace:
I know my Savior pleads for me

Of Your love there is no doubt
Of Your mercies I am sure
Jesus knows my need and for me intercedes
All my hope is Christ
In the Beginning
In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with God
And the Word was God, He was
With God in the beginning
Through Him all things were made
Apart from Him nothing
Was made that has been made
In Him was life
And the life was the light of men
The light shines in the dark
But the darkness could not comprehend

For God so loved the world
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
That He gave His only Son
If you believe you will not die
You will receive eternal life
All That Thrills My Soul
Spirit of the living God, open up my eyes
Show me the pride that blinds me
Stoop to my weakness, mighty as You are
And show me Jesus as I ought to see Him
For when I see Him, truly see Him

All that thrills my soul is Jesus
No greater joy can be
He bore all my sins and sorrows
His perfect love
Is all that I need

Father, may Your living Word penetrate my heart
And undo the lies that bind me
Shine in my darkness, mighty as You are
And make me know You as I ought to know You
For when I know You, truly know You

Jesus, still my wandering heart, tie me to the rock
That rests on Your work completed
Keep me from falling, mighty as You are
That I may love You as I ought to love You
For when I love You, truly love You
All Creatures of Our God and King
All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
O praise Him! Allelujah!
Thou, burning sun with golden beam
Thou, silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah!

Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness
O praise Him! Allelujah!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
And praise the Spirit, Three-in-One
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah!

All the redeemed washed by His blood
Come and rejoice in His great love
O praise Him! Allelujah!
Christ has defeated every sin
Cast all your burdens now on Him
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Allelujah! Allelujah!
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah!

To Him who loves us
And is returning be honor
For we shall see Him in His glory

He shall return in pow'r to reign
Heaven and earth will join to say
O praise Him! Allelujah!
Then who shall fall on bended knee?
All creatures of our God and King
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Allelujah! Allelujah!
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Allelujah! Allelujah! Allelujah!
We Will Glorify - Live
We will glorify the Lamb
We will glorify the Lord of lords
Who is the great I am
Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty
We will bow before His throne
We will worship Him in righteousness
We will worship Him alone
We will glorify the King of kings
We will glorify the Lamb
We will glorify the Lord of lords
Who is the great I am
He is Lord of Heaven, Lord of Earth
He is Lord of all who live
He is Lord above the universe
All praise to Him we give
Oh, hallelujah to the King of kings
Hallelujah to the Lamb
Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords
Who is the great I am
We will glorify the King of kings
We will glorify the Lamb
We will glorify the Lord of lords
Who is the great I am
Who is the great I am
When Trials Come - Live
When trials come no longer fear
For in the pain our God draws near
To fire a faith worth more than gold
And there His faithfulness is told
And there His faithfulness is told

Within the night I know Your peace
The breath of God brings strength to me
And new each morning mercy flows
As treasures of the darkness grow
As treasures of the darkness grow

I turn to Wisdom not my own
For every battle You have known
My confidence will rest in You
Your love endures Your ways are good
Your love endures Your ways are good

When I am weary with the cost
I see the triumph of the cross
So in it's shadow I shall run
Till He completes the work begun
Till He completes the work begun

One day all things will be made new
I'll see the hope You called me to
And in your kingdom paved with gold
I'll praise your faithfulness of old
I'll praise your faithfulness of old

I'll praise your faithfulness of old
I'll praise your faithfulness of old
O Great God - Live
O great God of highest heaven
Occupy my lowly heart
Own it all and reign supreme
Conquer every rebel power
Let no vice or sin remain
That resists Your holy war
You have loved and purchased me
Make me Yours forevermore

I was blinded by my sin
Had no ears to hear Your voice
Did not know Your love within
Had no taste for heaven's joys
Then Your Spirit gave me life
Opened up Your Word to me
Through the gospel of Your Son
Gave me endless hope and peace

Help me now to live a life
That's dependent on Your grace
Keep my heart and guard my soul
From the evils that I face
You are worthy to be praised
With my every thought and deed
O great God of highest heaven
Glorify Your Name through me
I Asked the Lord That I Might Grow - Live
I asked the Lord that I might grow
In faith and love, and ev'ry grace,
Might more of His salvation know,
And seek more earnestly His face.

'Twas He who taught me thus to pray,
And He, I trust, has answered prayer,
But it has been in such a way
As almost drove me to despair.

I hoped that in some favoured hour
At once He'd answer my request
And, by His love's constraining pow'r,
Subdue my sins, and give me rest.

Instead of this, He made me feel
The hidden evils of my heart
And let the angry pow'rs of hell
Assault my soul, in ev'ry part.

Yea, more with His own hand He seemed
Intent to aggravate my woe,
Crossed all the fair designs I schemed,
Humbled my heart, and laid me low.

"Lord, why is this," I trembling cried;
"Wilt Thou pursue Thy worm to death?"
"Tis in this way," the Lord replied,
"I answer prayer for grace and faith."

"These inward trials I employ
From self and pride to set thee free
And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me.

And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me.
When I Survey the Wondrous Cross - Live
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ, my God.
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small.
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

Blessed Assurance

Come, Holy Spirit, my soul assure

Relieve my fears that I no more

May doubt the love of Christ for me

That my debt is paid, that I’ve been made free

O Comforter, in me reside

When the tempter speaks be my faithful Guide

Show Your promise is for me secured

For the battle be my heavenly sword


Blessed assurance; Jesus is mine! Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!

Heir of salvation, purchase of God, born of His Spirit, washed in His blood


Illumine me with the Savior’s light

To dispel my thoughts in the blackest night

In darkest hour to my soul reveal

The wounds which all my sorrows heal

Impress that seal, His image leave

And by Your pow’r to His grace I’ll cleave

Until faith be sight and prayer be praise

When beholding Jesus face to face


This my story, this my song

Born of Spirit, washed in Blood

This my story, this my song

In my Savior I belong
Cling to Christ

Father, I can come to You

And boast of deeds I’ve done

In my pride I strive to earn

The favor Christ has won

He alone pleads my acceptance

All my works aside

So I come with empty hands

And I cling to Christ


Father, I can go astray

And battle needless fears

Voices tell me I’m condemned

And that I can’t draw near

But Your Spirit calls me homeward

With Your words of life

Jesus bore my every sin

So, I cling to Christ


It’s more than I can do

To keep my hold on You

But all my hope and peace

Is that You cling to me


Father, all my earthly aims

In time will turn to dust

Let me learn that loss is gain

For those who know Your love

All the treasures of this world

Will never satisfy

You alone are endless joy

So, I cling to Christ
Abba, Father

Abba, Father! we approach You

In our Savior’s precious name

We, Your children, here assembled

Now Your promised blessing claim

From our sins His blood has washed us

Now we can draw nigh

By the power of Your Spirit

“Abba, Father” now we cry

“Abba, Father” now we cry


Once as prodigals we wandered

Hating what was all our need

But Your grace o’er sin abounding

Rescued us from misery

You the prodigals have pardoned

Kissed us with Your love

Spread the feast and now You’ve called us

E’er to dwell with You above

E’er to dwell with You above


You have found Your once lost children

They now live who once were dead

“It is right,” we hear You saying

“For my people to be glad”


Abba, Father! all adore You

Shout Your praise in Heav’n above

While in us they learn the wonders

Of Your wisdom, grace, and love

Soon before Your throne assembled

Gladly we’ll proclaim:

“Glory, everlasting glory

Be to God and to the Lamb!

Be to God and to the Lamb!”
Our Song from Age to Age

Oh God of power, living Word

The One who made the stars

Who with Your glory filled the earth

From dust made beating hearts

You loved us when we fell away

Poured mercy on our souls

And promised grace would come to save

To loose death’s iron hold


You are our song from age to age

Our voices unite to recount Your praise

Again and again


Oh God of promises fulfilled

The God who took on flesh

Who did all that the Father willed

Was humbled unto death

You bore our cross of sin and shame

Endured our agony

With gladness we now bear Your name

And worship at Your feet


You are our song from age to age

Our voices unite to recount Your praise

Again and again

You are our song from age to age

We will proclaim Your pow’r to save

Again and again


Oh God, who surely guides our steps

Through tempests and through trials

Our Shepherd King, Your way is best

Though tears now veil our eyes

Your steadfast love, our perfect hope

Our eyes are fixed on grace

We have no doubt You’ll lead us home

To finally see Your face


Oh God of all of history

Enthroned in realms of light

What eyes of faith have strained to see

Will one day fill our sight

With all the saints we’ll lay our crowns

Before the Savior’s feet

And sing as all the heav’ns resound

For all eternity

Great Things

To God be the glory, great things He has done

So loved He the world that He gave us His Son

Who yielded His life, an atonement for sin

And opened the life-gate that all may go in


To God be the glory for wisdom and grace

That chose us and made us the heirs of His name

He justified freely His daughters and sons

And gave us His Spirit, the seal of His love


Praise God from whom all blessings flow

Through our Savior Jesus Christ

He has raised us up to a glorious hope

Rejoice, you ransomed ones

Great things He has done


To God be the glory, He joined us with Christ

We share in His death and we’re hid in His life

We stand in His righteousness, never our own

And sit with Him now on His heavenly throne

Prelude

You Have Been Raised
How do we know we’ve been forgiven?
How do we know that we have been made clean?
How do we know we’ll go to heaven?
How do we know we’ve been redeemed?

You have been raised, the tomb has been opened
Nothing can take away our hope in You
You have been raised
You have been raised, the work is completed
Hell and its powers have been defeated
You have been raised

Now we are free from condemnation
There is no judgment left for us to fear
We don’t have to wonder if we’re welcome
You are the One who’s brought us near

The price You paid for us
Has fully been accepted
Because of Your shed blood
We cannot be rejected
Jesus Lives
I no longer fear the grave
Christ has come
Took the sting of death away
Through His saving blood
Though my body fails and my flesh grows weak
Till my final breath, to this hope I’ll cling

Jesus lives and so shall I
I’ll be raised from the dust with Christ on high
Jesus lives no more to die
And when He returns, with Him I’ll rise
Jesus lives

In this fallen world I cry
For the day
When Your glory splits the sky
And You come to reign
All creation waits for that promised hour
When the saints of God are revealed in power

Not death nor any power of hell can separate me from
The love, the love of my Savior
To Live Is Christ
Before You gave us life and breath
You numbered all our days
You set Your gracious love on us
And chose us to be saved
This fleeting life is passing by
With all its joys and pain
But we believe to live is Christ
And death is gain

To live is Christ, to die is gain
In every age this truth remains
We will not fear, we’re unashamed
To live is Christ, to die is gain

And though we grieve for those we love
Who fall asleep in Christ
We know they’ll see the Savior’s face
And gaze into His eyes
So now we grieve, yet we don’t grieve
As those who have no hope
For just as Jesus rose again
He’ll raise His own

And now we’re longing for the day
We’ll see the Lamb once slain
Who saved a countless multitude
To glorify His name
We’re yearning for the wedding feast
Of Jesus and His bride
His nail-scarred hands will finally
Bring us to His side
He Has Risen
Come see the mournful grave
Where once a body lay
Our God in human form
By wrath and judgment torn
But He’s no longer here
His death has conquered death
Our guilt has disappeared
In His forgiveness

Jesus, He has risen
Jesus, He’s alive
Opened the gates of heaven
His death has brought us life

Come see what God has done
For vile and wicked ones
The innocent is judged
Unlovely ones are loved
Our joy is now complete
For death has lost its sting
And we are called to live
Life in His victory

Jesus has done enough
Our hope cannot be shaken
Because God raised Him up
We cannot be forsaken
Your Name Alone Can Save
When we were dead in our transgressions
Jesus, You came to bring us back to God
You canceled the debt that stood against us
Set it aside, nailing it to the cross
Now with joy we can proclaim

You’ve overcome the grave
You took our curse away
There is no other name by which we’re saved
For in Your death we died
In You we have new life
Jesus, Your name alone can save

Now death has lost its sting forever
Because You arose, we do not hope in vain
You defeated every evil power
Disarming them all, bearing our guilt and shame
And forever we’ll proclaim

In Your name there is freedom, life, and peace
In the name above all names
In Your name there is power—darkness flees
At the name above all names
We Have Been Healed
You bore our sins in Your body
As You were hung on a tree
So we might die to rebellion
And live for Him who set us free

You were mocked and reviled
Suffering in our place
Trusting all to Your Father
So enemies could know Your grace

We have been healed, justified
Made alive in the life of Christ
Righteous blood covers every sin
Risen Lamb, heaven’s light
Crucified and now alive
In Your love You have drawn us in

Like straying sheep we were wandering
Destitute and alone
You sought us out like a shepherd
You carried us and brought us home

All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
Hail The Day
Hail the day that Christ arose
Through the skies to worlds unknown
Glorious there He ever reigns
Object of all heaven’s praise

See Him lift His hands above
See the scars of His great love
He has conquered death and sin
Saving all who hope in Him

Hallelujah, hallelujah
The King of Love is on His throne
Hallelujah, hallelujah
His grace will lead us safely home

Though He dwells beyond the stars
His redeemed are on His heart
Even now He intercedes
Jesus cares for all our needs
We Will Rise
A seed falls down from the heights
And is buried in the earth
It silently lies in the ground
Awaiting a rebirth
So it is with those who die
Their lips confessing Christ
Because He is risen
With Him they will rise

Shall we mourn as this world mourns
Or shall we rest in truth?
Though outwardly we waste away
Within we are renewed
The weight of glory far transcends
These momentary trials
Because He is risen
With Him we will rise
We will rise

Weeping may last for an evening
But rejoicing comes with the dawn

To all the wonders God will do
Imagination’s blind
What He has made, He’ll make anew
In the twinkling of an eye
For death itself will be destroyed
Swallowed up by life
Because He is risen
With Him we will rise
We will rise
You Are Our Hope
Comfort for weary sinners
Strength for the struggling saint
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
Peace when the waves are pounding
When voices of hope sound faint
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
How can grief remain when our Savior reigns?

You are our hope, You are our joy
You are our overcoming King
So we sing “Hallelujah, Jesus is alive”
Risen from death, ascended on high
Glorious by the Father’s side
So we sing “Hallelujah, Jesus is alive”

Power to fight temptation
The world and the devil’s lies
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
Purpose in all our suffering
And joy that will never die
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
How can grief remain when our Savior reigns?

Jesus, victorious, in the heavens exalted
Jesus, give us eyes to see Your glory
Oh, What A Day
Let the joy begin, let our songs ring out
Let our hearts be glad, love has banished doubt
See the empty cross, all our debts are gone
Only grace remains, for the victory’s won

Oh what a day, what a glorious day
Oh what a day, what a glorious day
When You conquered death
And rose up from the grave
What a day
What a day

See the empty tomb, see the grave clothes there
He has left this place, you won’t find Him here
All our fears have fled, let our hopes arise
Heaven waits for us, we will never die

There is still a day that we’re awaiting
When the glorious One we love appears
He will take us home with Him forever
He will finally wipe away our tears
O My Soul, Arise

Arise, my soul, arise

Shake off your guilty fears

The bleeding sacrifice

On my behalf appears

Before the throne my surety stands

Before the throne my surety stands

My name is written on His hands


He ever lives above

For me to intercede

His all redeeming love

His precious blood to plead

His blood atoned for every race

His blood atoned for every race

And sprinkles now the throne of grace


O my soul, arise

Behold the risen Christ

Your Great High Priest

Your spotless sacrifice

O my soul, arise

God owns you as His child

Shake off your guilty fears

My soul, arise


Five bleeding wounds He bears

Received on Calvary

They pour effectual prayers

They strongly plead for me:

“Forgive him, O forgive,” they cry

“Forgive him, O forgive,” they cry

“Don’t let that ransomed sinner die!”


My God is reconciled

His pard’ning voice I hear

He owns me as His child

I can no longer fear

With confidence I now draw nigh

With confidence I now draw nigh

And “Father, Abba, Father,” cry
How Great You Are

Our God is great

The Father of creation

His splendor fills the earth

The lightning crash

The thunder sings His praises

The galaxies can’t help but shout His worth


My soul must sing to You an offering

How great You are

My soul must sing, oh, let the heavens ring

How great You are

Oh, how great You are


The Word made flesh

God’s promise to the fallen

He came with pow’r to save

The light of life was crushed for our rebellion

He died our death and rose up from the grave


Our King will come

With trumpet blasts resounding

To claim His blood-washed bride

He’ll rend the skies, descending in His glory

And in an instant faith will turn to sight

Glorious Christ

The radiance of the Father

Before the dawn of time

You spoke and all creation came to be

The molecules and planets

Reveal Your great design

And every one was made so we could see

So we could see


You are the glorious Christ

The greatest of all delights

Your power is unequaled

Your love beyond all heights

No greater sacrifice

Than when You laid down Your life

We join the song of angels

Who praise You day and night

Glorious Christ


You left the air of heaven

To breathe the dust of earth

And dwell among the outcast and the poor

You came to be forsaken

And died to take our curse

So You could be our joy forevermore

Forevermore


You’re seated now in heaven

Enthroned at God’s right hand

You’ve shattered death and freed us

From our fears

And though we cannot see You

You’re coming back again

And all will be made right when You appear

And all will be made right when You appear
Undone

Your Spirit had awakened

Our lifeless hearts to see

The King in brilliant glory

Revealed in majesty

We were ruined in Your presence

And tearing at the seams

Our eyes had gazed upon the King of kings


We fall down in awe of You

We fall down, undone

We fall down before You, Lord

Undone


Our hands had crafted idols

Our lips had spoken lies

Every wayward thought we had

Against us testified

But You were rich in mercy

To provide what You demand

And now on Christ, the solid rock, we stand


Holy, Holy, Holy One
Spirit of God

The blessing of the Father

Gift of grace and love

The promise of the Savior

For power from above

Oh, wondrous gift that’s given

For confidence and mission

Holy Spirit, You make all things new


Spirit of God, breathe on me now

Source of life, come, revive my weary heart

Spirit of God, shine on me now

Light of life, come, ignite my longing heart


Come and lift the dark clouds

Of doubt and unbelief

Shine upon my soul now

For by Your rays I see

Clearer, closer, deeper

The love of my Redeemer

Holy Spirit, You make all things new


Where You breathe hope thrives

The dead return to life

And the dark must flee the breaking day

By Your light I see the glory of my King

Beholding Him I will be changed

This Is Our God

God, our Father, full of power

Maker of the heavens, Maker of the world

Forming all things, seen and unseen

Truly the Almighty beyond all measured worth

Holy is His Name


We believe the Lord our God is One

Father, Spirit, Son; This is our God!

We believe forever He will reign

Let the church proclaim: This is our God!


Our Lord Jesus sent to save us

Born unto a virgin, lived a perfect life

Greatly suffered, dying for us

From the grave He’s risen, seated now on high

Holy is His Name


Jesus will come back again

To judge the living and the dead

Usher in the age to come

Let everyone sing “Amen”


Spirit, holy, One in glory

Speaking through the prophets

Empowering the Church

Life is given by and through Him

With the Son and Father, worshiped and adored

Holy is His Name
You Stand Alone

You spoke and time began, light dawned at Your command

And by Your Word the earth began to move

Carved mountains with Your hands, breathed life into all men

You made it all and saw that it was good


There is no rival to You, O God

All kings and idols will one day fall


Who among the gods is like You?

Who could ever measure all You’ve done, O God?

Creator, Sustainer, Merciful Savior

Forever on Your throne, You stand alone


Your Spirit gave the Law in kindness to us all

And though we never kept it, You were true

Lawmaker, You have saved lawbreakers from the grave

And by Your Son our guilt has been removed


Your endless glory shines through Your Son

There is no story of greater love


There is no one like our God (You stand alone)
Your Name Is Matchless

We were sinners, we were orphans

We were looking for a home

We were lost and we were broken

Wandering alone

Looking down at our condition

You sent Your Son to change our fate

Though we were hopelessly imprisoned

He came to take our place


Glory to the name of Jesus

Glory to the only name that saves

Ransomed the captives

Your name is matchless


What a mystery to fathom

That we’re Your children set apart

For we were enemies, not pilgrims

Prodigals at heart

But Your Spirit now has caused us

To no longer doubt Your love

Abba, Father, You have bought us

Adopted through Your Son


Glory to the name of Jesus

Glory to the only name that saves

Ransomed the captives

Your name is matchless

Glory to the name that freed us

Glory to the love that made a way

Beauty for ashes; Your name is matchless



Ponder all we have been given:

Heirs to God through Jesus’ name

A stingless death has been made certain

And glory now awaits

Your glory now awaits
Sooner Count the Stars

I could sooner count the stars

Than number all Your ways

Though I only know in part

That part exceeds all praise

As sunlight fills the skies

Your goodness fills my life

For all Your precious gifts

Receive my gratefulness


I could sooner drink the seas

Than fathom all Your love

Like a never ceasing stream

Are mercies through Your Son

The death of Christ alone

Deserves eternal song

For such a love as His

Receive my gratefulness


No praise is high enough

No thanks is deep enough

No life is long enough

To tell of all You’ve done

No shout is loud enough

No words are strong enough

No song is sweet enough

To sing Your love


I could sooner turn back time

Than turn Your heart away

Though the years go fleeting by

Your mercies never change

Before You made the sun

Your love was set on us

For all Your faithfulness

Receive my gratefulness

Gladly Would I Leave Behind Me

Gladly would I leave behind me

All the pleasure I have known

To pursue surpassing treasures

At the throne of God the Son

Worthy of unending worship

Love and loveliness is He

By His precious death were millions

From the jaws of death set free


Gladly would I give to Jesus

All affection, everything

For the washing of His mercy

Makes my ransomed heart to sing

Rising up from those who see

Christ exalted, bright and burning

Full of pow’r and purity


Where else can I go?

Jesus, You’re the One

That I was made to know

What else can I do?

Jesus, You’re my all

I gladly run to You


Gladly would I flee temptations

For their troubles fill my life

Turn and seek my God and Savior

For His goodness satisfies

Earthly treasures, all are passing

Thieves break in and rust destroys

But in God are awesome splendor

Love, and everlasting joys


Gladly would I give to Jesus

All affection, everything

For the washing of His mercy

Makes my ransomed heart to sing

All Is Well

The sun beams on behind the clouds

And in the dark still grace abounds

All is well because of God’s great love

The road of disappointment runs

Where unseen mercies wait for us

And all is well because of God’s great love


How brightly shines the love of the Father

In our Savior, Jesus Christ

With faithful hands He fulfills every promise

He will never leave our side


He feels our weakness, knows our need

And for our good He intercedes

All is well because of God’s great love

Through every failure, every fear

The Lord of comfort draws us near

And all is well because of God’s great love


His coming soon will fill the sky

And all that’s wrong will be made right

With newborn eyes we will behold

The glory of the risen Lord

All will be well because of God’s great love

Yes, all is well because of God’s great love

Immovable Our Hope Remains

Immovable our hope remains

Though shifting sands before us lie

The One who washed away our stains

Shall bear us safely to the skies

The floods may rise, the winds may beat

Torrential rains descend

Yet God His own will not forget

He’ll love and keep us till the end

You’ll love and keep us till the end


This is eternal life: to know

The living God and Christ, the Son

The Savior will not let us go

Until His saving work is done

Our debt was great, as was our need

But now the price is paid

Who can behold Immanuel bleed

And doubt His willingness to save?

We trust Your willingness to save


The Lord acquits, who can condemn?

Though Satan’s accusations fly

His pow’r can never reach our names

To blot them from the Book of Life

The Son has surely made us free

His Word forever stands

And all our joy is knowing we

Are graven on His wounded hands

We’re graven on Your wounded hands


Built into Christ, secure we stand

For with His Spirit we’ve been sealed

By grace we’ll see the promised land

Where every sorrow shall be healed

To God who gave His only Son

To Jesus Christ, our Lord

To God the Spirit, Three-in-one

Be songs of praise forevermore

We’ll sing Your praise forevermore


Mighty Fortress

A mighty fortress is our God

A shield that never fails

Amid the flood of mortal ills

His power will prevail

Our ancient foe is cruel and armed with hate

Yet with one word he’ll bow to Jesus’ reign


Hope in God, O my soul

He is strong and He is strong to save

Hope in God

He’s a rock and your hiding place

He’s a mighty fortress


We dare not trust in our own hand

Or all would be in vain

Our confidence is in the One

Who holds the worlds in place

He fights for us, the sovereign Lord of hosts

From age to age the triumph’s His alone

Father, How Sweet

Father, how sweet must be the pleasure

You find in Your eternal Son

For long before You made the heavens

Both You and He rejoiced as one

And long before You formed the angels

Before You made the day and night

Jesus exulted in Your presence

And He was all of Your delight


Father, what love You’ve shown to rebels

That You would send Your Son so dear

Into this world of grief and trouble

To bring unworthy sinners near

We’ll never fathom how it pained You

When You supplied the offering

To rescue those who had disdained You

To watch Your dear Son suffering


Jesus, it fills our hearts with wonder

That You would leave Your heavenly place

To take on flesh to thirst and hunger

To save the ones who spurned Your grace

You came to forfeit every mercy

To die that mercy we would find

And then You hung alone in darkness

So in our hearts Your grace would shine


Jesus, in glory You’ve ascended

Never again to leave Your throne

Because of You we are befriended

Received and welcomed as God’s own

Father, how sweet now is Your pleasure

In us, Your daughters and Your sons

We will delight in You forever

In Jesus You have made us one

My Redeemer's Love

My Redeemer’s love is deeper

Than the depths of sin and hell

He who was enthroned in glory

Came to bring us to Himself

My Redeemer’s love is wider

Than the breach my sins had made

He reached down into my darkness

He alone has pow’r to save


Deeper than the rolling seas

Higher than the mountain peaks

Your love is all I need


My Redeemer’s love is stronger

Than my fiercest enemies

He will hold me in the tempest

Through the flood He carries me

My Redeemer’s love will lead me

Through the deepest valley here

He will shepherd me and guide me

He will ever keep me near


Deeper than the rolling seas

Higher than the mountain peaks

Your love is all I need

Stronger than the rushing wind

Shattering the power of sin

Your love is all I need


My Redeemer’s love grows sweeter

As eternity draws near

I’ll enjoy His love forever

At His throne for endless years

My Redeemer’s love will fill me

On the day I see His face

I will love Him back forever

And forever sing His praise


Nothing That My Hands Can Do

There’s nothing that my hands can do

To save my guilty soul

I cannot cleanse my filthy stains

Or make my spirit whole

For nothing but the blood of Christ

Can all my sins erase

I dare not claim my righteousness

But hide within His grace

‘Tis Christ who saved me from the depths

God’s pardon I’ve received

I’m washed within His precious blood

My heart is sprinkled clean


I’ll praise the God of holiness

Of justice, truth, and might

Who guides me by His mighty hand

To walk within His light

While Satan weaves his shallow lies

God speaks to me in love

Reminding me His only Son

Has bought me with His blood

And Christ dispels my every doubt

Through Him I am redeemed

I love because He loved me first

I live because He lives


My life is but a fleeting sigh

A tear within the sea

But You are everlasting, Lord

And You’ve predestined me

To leave this fading world behind

Not fearing death will come

For then I’ll look on Jesus Christ

And to His arms I’ll run

And when I see Him face to face

What glory that will be

To look upon my Savior’s scars

And know they were for me

See, He Comes

See, He comes upon the clouds

Jesus Christ, our King appears

All the saints bought by His blood

Will rise to meet Him in the air

Earth and sea shall flee away

All creation waits and groans

For the Lord Redeemer comes

To take His longing exiles home


Hallelujah, hallelujah

Come, O Lord, on earth to reign

Hallelujah, hallelujah

We await the coming day


Those who mocked and scorned His name

Pierced and nailed Him to the tree

Deeply wail, in sorrow grieve

When they the true Messiah see

Every eye will see the Lord

Dressed in dreadful majesty

Every knee shall bow before

The Judge of all eternity


Still He bears the holy scars

Evidence of saving grace

All the saints bought by His blood

Shall then rejoice to see His face

Yes, amen, let all adore

Christ on His eternal throne

All the pow’r and might are Yours

Come, claim the kingdom as Your own

Alive
My heart of stone was dead to You
Asleep within a world
That scorned its maker
Until You breathed into my soul
And I woke up to You
My glorious Savior
You became my all
You became my all

Now I am alive, I am alive in You
You are alive, You are alive in me
You called my name
And raised me from the dead
Now I am alive, I am alive in You

In You my life’s completely new
I’m blameless in Your eyes
Because of Calvary
The Father welcomes me with joy
Your Spirit makes me know
Your great love for me
Jesus, You’re my all
Jesus, You’re my all

Bought with a price that cannot be measured
Chosen before all time
You are my joy, my prize, and my treasure
Jesus, You are my life

For the Son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim

All I Have Is Christ (Live)
I once was lost in darkest night
Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave
I had no hope that You would own
A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still

But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross
And I beheld God's love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace

Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life

Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
And live so all might see
The strength to follow Your commands
Could never come from me
Oh Father, use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
And let my song forever be
My only boast is You

Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life

Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
Name Above All Names
From the brightness of His glory
Jesus, the Son of God, descends
Takes on the nature of a servant

The Father willed to crush Him
As a sacrifice for sin
He satisfied God's justice

Over everything
Exalted to the highest place

I want to sing of Your love
Came as a man
Humble, You died the sinner's death
I want to sing of Your love

Your love has saved me
By Your grace I now draw near, and
Your love has set me
Free to glorify Your name
And I, I want to sing of Your love

I'll never forget
That You have bought me with Your blood
I want to sing of Your love
In all I do
May Your great love be shining through
I want to sing of Your love

And on that day
When You come back to claim Your own
Yes, we will sing of Your love
Then we'll bow down
Praise You forever at Your throne
Yes, we will sing of Your love
I Will Cast My Cares
Jesus, I'm frail, I'm so very weak
My faithfulness fails, my courage will flee
But You are my rock, my shelter and shade
When I'm burdened down, You'll carry the weight
So I will cast my cares on You
Yes, I will cast my cares on You
I will rest within Your arms
Knowing I am safe from harm
I will cast my cares on You
When I'm overwhelmed and I cannot stand
You hear every cry and You lift my head
I'm desperate for grace and mercy anew
I must have Your strength, Oh I must have You
So I will cast my cares on You
Yes, I will cast my cares on You
I will rest within Your arms
Knowing I am safe from harm
I will cast my cares on You
You are my faithfull God
So I will cast my cares on You
Yes, I will cast my cares on You
Jesus
I will rest within Your arms
Knowing I am safe from harm
I will cast my cares on You
Every morning Your mercies anew
You're always faithfull
You are good, You are Good.
O Wondrous Love
O wondrous love that will not let me go
I cling to You with all my strength and soul
Yet if my hold should ever fail
This wondrous love will never let me go

O wondrous love that's come to dwell in me
Lord who am I that I should come to know
Your tender voice assuring me
This wondrous love will never let me go

I'm resting in the everlasting arms
In the ever faithful heart
The Shepherd of my life
You'll carry me on Your mighty wings of grace
Keeping me until the day
I look into Your eyes

O wondrous love that sings of Calvary
The sweetest sound this sinner's ever known
The song of Your redeeming Son
Whose wondrous love will never let me go

O wondrous love that rushes over me
I can't escape this river's glorious flow
You overwhelm my days with good
Your wondrous love will never let me go
Your Hand Upon Me
O Lord You have searched me
And You know my ways
You perceive all my thoughts from afar
Your hand is upon me wherever I go
Before I form each word
You already know

If I rise on the wings of the dawn You are there
If I rest on the far side of the sea
Your love hems me in both behind and before
You have laid Your hand upon me
You have laid Your hand upon me

Where can I flee from Your presence, O Lord
If I sleep in the depths You are there
Your day will consume all the shadows of night
The dark cannot hide
From Your brilliant light
Here At the Throne
How can I ever begin to thank You
For all You've done for me
You emptied Yourself Lord
And You became poor
To lavish grace on me
And You have loved me Lord
With an everlasting love

So here at the throne of grace I stand
To exalt the great I AM
Where the blood of Jesus covers me
Here at the throne of grace I stand
Finding mercy at Your hand
And Your mighty power in time of need
Here at the throne of grace

In You is mercy and sweet forgiveness
And cleansing of my sins
In You is beauty all heaven's glory
All holiness and strength
And You have loved me Lord
With an everlasting love
High Above All Things
Give me a passion to see Your glory
A heart that worships You alone
Cleanse me, forgive me for my self-seeking
That I may seek to make You known
I want to serve You, I want to please You
My one desire is to

See the name of Jesus lifted
High above all things
And the knowledge of Your glory
Fill the earth
To see the name of Jesus lifted
High above all things
And a fragrant offering
Ascending to the King in every place

Your heart, Your passion to give all nations
Gladness and joy in Jesus Christ
Rivers of blessing, mercy and kindness
Purchased by Your great sacrifice
So we join our voices to sing Your praises
Our one desire is to
Across the Great Divide
There is no more separation
There is no more need to hide
You have brought us near, O Jesus
Across the great divide
There is no more condemnation
Since the blood flowed from Your side
You have brought us near, O Jesus
Across the great divide

Oh glory to Your holy name
For the distance that You came
To bear my guilt and take my blame to save me
From heaven to a cross of pain
Oh the distance that You came
So I will love You without shame
You saved me, You saved me

There is no more fear of judgment
The Father's wrath is satisfied
You have brought us near, O Jesus
Across the great divide
There's a way beyond the curtain
Through our Priest and King on high
You have brought us near, O Jesus
Across the great divide

Oh glory to Your holy name
For the distance that You came
To bear my guilt and take my blame to save me
From heaven to a cross of pain
Oh the distance that You came
So I will love You without shame
You saved me, You saved me
Who Is Like Our God
The Lord is not our equal
He doesn't need the help of man
Who could ever give Him counsel
Who could ever stop His sovereign plan
Though men may boast of wisdom
And be filled with pride within
Who is bold enough to answer
When his Maker comes to question him

Though rulers rise against Him
The King of Heaven laughs
He rebukes them in His anger
And terrifies them in His wrath
He punishes the wicked
Pours judgment out on sin
Yet this Champion of Justice
Is a Savior if you call on Him

And we call on the name
Of the holy sovereign Lord
The King of all the earth
And we hope in the power
Of His awesome mighty hand
We tremble at His word
Who is like our God

The heavens sound with thunder
As His majesty is shown
The four and twenty elders
Fall down and worship at His throne
His eyes are flames of fire
And His face is like the sun
He's the Alpha and Omega
The One who was and is to come
Know You
Come and shine Your Spirit's light
Upon these darkened eyes
Once again reveal Your majesty
May I behold the splendor of
The great redeeming Lamb
The One whose wondrous grace possesses me
Lord how I am longing

‘Cause I want to know You
And the love that passes comprehension
Know You and the power of the Cross
I want to know You
And the glory of Your resurrection
Lord I'm crying out for more of You

Come and open up my ears
To hear Your glorious truth
Lord Your words are my soul's very life
For I consider everything in this world as a loss
Compared to You my treasure and delight
Lord how I am longing
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord, Oh praise His name
From the heights of heav'n He reigns
Seated in the highest place
Surrounded by unending praise
Praise Him for His mighty deeds
Awesome in His majesty
Praise Him now with trumpet sound
Lift your voice and dance around

Everything that has breath, praise the Lord
Everything that's in us, praise Him
Everything that has breath, praise the Lord

Praise the Lord with instruments
Praise Him for His excellence
Look at what He's done for us
Bore our sins upon the cross
Praise the Lord with all you are
Mind and soul and will and heart
From His hand comes everything
He alone is God and King
The Lord Is
The depths of Your grace who can measure
You fully supply all I need
You restore my weary soul again and again
And lead me in Your righteousness and peace

You're with me through every dark valley
There's nothing that I have to fear
You are there to comfort me again and again
Protecting me, assuring me You're near

The Lord is
The Lord is my shepherd
The Lord is
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want

You gave Your own life for my ransom
So I could rejoice at Your side
You have shown Your faithfulness again and again
There's nothing good that You will not provide

The Lord is
The Lord is my shepherd
The Lord is
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want

I will dwell in Your house
All the days of my life
I will dwell in Your house
All the days of my life

The Lord is
The Lord is my shepherd
The Lord is
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
Greater Than We Can Imagine
Every day we'll bless You and praise Your name
And on Your glorious splendor we will dwell
On Your wondrous works, Lord, we'll meditate
And of Your awesome power we will tell
We'll speak of Your salvation and Your abundant goodness

Because You are greater than we can imagine
You are too beautiful for us to fathom
Oh, You are great, and greatly to be praised

Every generation shall sing Your worth
And magnify Your mercy and Your grace
We'll sing about the Savior who came to earth
To bear the sins of those He came to save
You fill our hearts with wonder
We'll worship You forever
A Debtor to Mercy
A debtor to mercy alone
Of covenant mercy I sing
I come with Your righteousness on
My humble offering to bring
The judgments of Your holy law
With me can have nothing to do
My Savior's obedience and blood
Hide all my transgressions
From view

The work which Your goodness began
The arm of Your strength will complete
Your promise is yes and amen
And never was forfeited yet
The future or things that are now
No power below or above
Can make You Your purpose forego
Or sever my soul from Your love

My name from the palms of Your hands
Eternity will not erase
Impressed on Your heart it remains
In marks of indelible grace
Yes I, to the end will endure
Until I bow down at Your throne
Forever and always secure
Forever and always secure
Forever and always secure
A debtor to mercy alone
Praise God
And as the earth start to spit out the heat
He will be near somehow
Watching disasters and laughing on it
As the bird start not to fly on the sky
He will be near somehow
Provokes people to be behind his lead
The One Whom Earth Refuse
Rush, blood
There's no one sees him in the crowd
Not human, nor a creature
His hand are fulfilled by the blood
Wreck and ash, people down
Keep your eyes even in the crowd
Dont give him any chance
Tears drop from your eyes as sorrow start to lead
He come from the dark, sing the song of the hell
From the distance he takes behemoth with him
Sing the song of hell
He abolish all he see
No one will live, and no one will survive
No one will live, and no one will survive
And as the earth start to spit out the heat
He will be near somehow
Watching disasters and laughing on it
(on it)
As the bird start not to fly on the sky
He will be near somehow
Provokes people to be behind his lead
(his lead)

Rush, blood
There's no one sees him in the crowd
Not human, nor a creature
His hand are fulfilled by the blood
Wreck and ash, people down
Keep your eyes even in the crowd
Dont give him any chance
The One Whom Earth Refuse
(Instument)

And in the end you realise those all
You are already late
You're in the time when the world meets the end

The Fathers Love
We do not have the lyrics for The Fathers Love yet.
Now Why This Fear
Now why this fear and unbelief?
Has not the Father put to grief,
His spotless Son for us?
And will the righteous Judge of men
Condemn me for that debt of sin
Now canceled at the cross?

Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
Jesus, You've rescued us
Through Your great love

Complete atonement You have made
And by Your death have fully paid
The debt Your people owed
No wrath remains for us to face
We're sheltered by Your saving grace
And sprinkled with Your blood

How sweet the sound of saving grace
How sweet the sound of saving grace
Christ died for me

Be still my soul and know this peace
The merits of your great high priest
Have bought your liberty
Rely then on His precious blood
Don't fear your banishment from God
Since Jesus sets you free

Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
Jesus, You've rescued us
Through Your great love

How sweet the sound of saving grace
How sweet the sound of saving grace
Christ died for me
How sweet the sound of saving grace
How sweet the sound of saving grace
Christ died for me

Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
Jesus, You've rescued us
Through Your great love
The Father's Love
We do not have the lyrics for The Father's Love yet.
Jesus, Thank You
The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
The agonies of Calvary
You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father's wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

By Your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near
Your enemy You've made Your friend
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end

Lover of my soul
I want to live for You
Glory to God in the Highest
Hear the angels sing of the King of kings
Who made Himself poor
See the mystery and the majesty
The Creator is born
Oh the Maker became a man
Let us sing what the angels sang

Glory to God in the highest
Glory to God in the highest
Our hope has appeared
God has drawn near
Glory to God alone

See the One who spans the heavens with His hand
With fingers so small
See this babe so poor all of heaven adores
He's the ruler of all
Let us worship our humble King
Adoration we humbly bring
Create In Me
Create in me a clean heart, oh God
And renew a right spirit within me
Create in me a clean heart, oh God
And renew a right spirit within me

Cast me not away from Thy presence, oh Lord
And take not Thy holy spirit from me
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
And renew a right spirit within me

Create in me a clean heart, oh God
And renew a right spirit within me
Create in me a clean heart, oh God
And renew a right spirit within me

Cast me not away from Thy presence, oh Lord
Take not Thy holy spirit from me
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
And renew a right spirit within me

Create in me a clean heart, oh God
And renew a right spirit within me
Create in me a clean heart, oh God
And renew a right spirit within me

Cast me not away from Thy presence, oh Lord
Take not Thy holy spirit from me
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
And renew a right spirit within me
Taste and See
When I was poor and helpless
The Lord, He heard my cry
He saved this wicked sinner
The King redeemed my life

Oh taste and see that God is good to us
Taste and see His never-failing love
Our God is good

You're near me when I'm broken
My comfort when I'm crushed
My hope in all afflictions
My God in whom I trust

I'll make my boast in Jesus
The One who is my life
His glory is my gladness
In Him I'm satisfied
Out of the Depths
Out of the depths, O Lord, I cry to You
When I am tempted to despair
Though I might fail to trust Your promises
You never fail to hear my prayer
And if You judged my sin
I'd never stand again
But I see mercy in Your hands

So more than watchmen for the morning
I will wait for You, my God
When my fears come with no warning
In Your Word I'll put my trust
When the harvest time is over and I still see no fruit
I will wait, I will wait for You

The secret mysteries belong to You
We only know what You reveal
And all my questions that are unresolved
Don't change the wisdom of Your will
In every trial and loss
My hope is in the cross
I Want to Be Where You Are
How sweet the place where You dwell, O Lord
My soul longs and faints for You
My heart sings out a loud song of joy
For I have known the living God

I want to be where You are, O Lord
I want to be where You are, O Lord
I'd rather have just one day with You
Than be anywhere else

There's no good thing that You will withhold
From those who live to follow You
I'd rather be Your servant, O God
Than have the riches of this world

Those who follow You go from strength to strength
Those who trust in You are filled with joy
Those who follow You go from strength to strength
Those who trust in You are filled with joy
Your Holy Majesty
You are high above all things
The heavens can't contain
Your radiance and Your beauty
You shine brighter than the sun
I'm ravished and undone
You've conquered me completely
Now I am longing for the time
When I will see Your

Holy, holy majesty
Your glory and Your splendor
Holy, holy majesty
You fill my soul with wonder
And unspeakable delight
At just the sight
Of Your holy majesty

Why would You shed Your own blood
For those who spurned Your love
And so many times refused Your grace
Why would You take up our curse
Why did You love us first
Oh You deserve eternal praise
Now I am longing for the time
When I will see Your
Song of the Lamb
Long ago
Before You made the stars above
You set Your everlasting love on us
And Your love endures
With tender cords
You drew us who had strayed so far
And like a might warrior stormed our hearts
Until we were Yours

So we will sing this song of gladness
Lift our hearts and holy hands
We will sing to You who loved us
We'll sing the song of the Lamb
We'll sing the song of the Lamb

All our sins
Have made a chasm deep and wide
We could never reach the other side
'Til You came to save
Glorious God
Emptied to become like us
A humble servant taking up a cross
To pour out Your grace
And Can It Be That I Should Gain (Live)
And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Savior's blood
Died He for me, who caused His pain
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

He left His Father's throne above
So free, so infinite His grace
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free
For O my God, it found out me!
Amazing love! How can it be,

That Thou, my God, shoudlst die for me?

Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
Fast bound in sin and nature's night
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee

Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God shouldst die for me?

No condemnation now I dread
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine
Alive in Him, my living Head
And clothed in righteousness divine
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown, through Christ my own
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou my God, shouldst die for me?
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou my God, shouldst die for me?
The Power of the Cross (Live)
Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood

This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Oh, to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Ev'ry bitter thought, ev'ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head
Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
Finished the vict'ry cry

Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free
Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

This, the power of the cross
Son of God, slain for us
What a love, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross
I Will Glory in My Redeemer (Live)
I will glory in my Redeemer
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
And hung Him on that judgment tree

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who crushed the power of sin and death
My only Savior before the holy Judge
The Lamb who is my righteousness
The Lamb who is my righteousness

I will glory in my Redeemer
My life He bought, my love He owns
I have no longings for another
I'm satisfied in Him alone

I will glory in my Redeemer
His faithfulness my standing place
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me
My feet are firm, held by His grace
My feet are firm, held by His grace

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who carries me on eagles' wings
He crowns my life with lovingkindness
His triumph song I'll ever sing

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold
His face forever to behold
His face forever to behold
Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (Live)
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name! I'm fixed upon it
Name of Thy redeeming love

Hitherto Thy love has blessed me
Thou hast brought me to this place
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

Oh to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, oh take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

Oh that day when freed from sinning
I shall see Thy lovely face
Full arrayed in blood-washed linen
How I'll sing Thy sovereign grace
Come, my Lord, no longer tarry
Bring Thy promises to pass
For I know Thy pow'r will keep me
Till I'm home with Thee at last
Oh the Deep, Deep Love (Live)
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fullness over me
Underneath me, all around me
Is the current of Your love
Leading onward, leading homeward
To Your glorious rest above

Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus

Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Spread His praise from shore to shore
How He came to pay our ransom
Through the saving cross He bore
How He watches o'er His loved ones
Those He died to make His own
How for them He's interceding
Pleading now before the throne

Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus

Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Far surpassing all the rest
It's an ocean full of blessing
In the midst of every test
Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
Mighty Savior, precious Friend
You will bring us home to glory
Where Your love will never end

Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Oh the deep, deep love
All I need and trust
Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
How Firm a Foundation (Live)
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
What more can He say than to you He hath said
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled

Fear not, I am with thee; oh be not dismayed
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand

When through the deep waters I call thee to go
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress

When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie
My grace all sufficient shall be thy supply
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine

The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to its foes
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I'll never, no never, no never forsake
It Is Well With My Soul (Live)
When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul

It is well with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
And has shed His own blood for my soul

My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part, but the whole
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul
All About Jesus
Every word of Your Word is true
They were all breathed out by You
Your Spirit wrote through men
Like a pen in the hand of a God Who knew
That we would need to know how much You love us so
You wrote it down for us forever, Oh
From Genesis to Revelation there's one story of Your great salvation
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
Shoutin' out from every page, there's one Hero that'll save the day
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
Every word of Your Word gives light
Like the sun that shines so bright
It leads us day by day
To the One, the Way, the Truth, the Life
And every time we read You give us what we need
To grow in grace and know You better, Oh
From Genesis to Revelation there's one story of Your great salvation
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
Shoutin' out from every page, there's one Hero that'll save the day
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
It's all about Jesus, even from Eden, we read
The serpent would be crushed by a seed of Eve 'cause
All glory belongs to the Son
Every story pointing to the Holy One, like
When Abraham put Isaac on the altar
He pulled the knife, but God, he never falters
Faithful to His promise He would provide
A substitute ram for the sacrifice, now
He gave commandments so we could see
His holiness and our desperate need, then
There were so many temporary sacrifices
None of them were perfect, no, but Christ is
The prophets spoke and they were not liars
God would send His own Son, to be Messiah
Rescue, redeem, restore, reclaim
Every saint loves His holy name, cause
He died on the cross to take our place
The final substitute and eternal grace
Then He rose from the grave and up to the throne
Until He comes again, to gather His own!
From Genesis to Revelation there's one story of Your great salvation
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
Shoutin' out from every page, there's one Hero that'll save the day
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
You're Coming Back
When all His promises come true
When every tear is wiped away and all will be made new
What a great day that will be when Jesus comes back for His own
He will reign eternally from heaven's throne
Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
You're coming back, coming back again
Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
You're coming back, coming back again
Like You said You would, and Your words are true
Oh, that's a fact: You're coming back
Nobody knows the day or hour
When You'll come riding through the skies
But You'll appear in holy power and all will be made right
You'll judge the evil in this world
The time for sadness will be through
And all God's people will rejoice to be with You!
Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
You're coming back, coming back again
Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
You're coming back, coming back again
Like You said You would, and Your words are true
Oh, that's a fact: You're coming back
Brick After Brick
God used to dwell in a house among His people
But now He has a home that's better than the first
It doesn't look like a building with a steeple
Now, He's living in the people of the Church
Brick after brick, God is building His temple
Brick after brick, He is making it strong
With Christ the sure foundation and His people as the stones
He is building a place He can live
Brick after brick
Christ is the Rock on which everything's depending
He's making sure His house is steady as can be
His love is strong and His promises unending
And He'll protect His Church from all her enemies
Brick after brick, God is building His temple
Brick after brick, He is making it strong
With Christ the sure foundation and His people as the stones
He is building a place He can live
Brick after brick
All His people gather 'round, singing out with joyful sound
Giving glory to their Maker
And they build each other up as they share the bread and cup
To remember their Savior
()
Brick after brick; Brick after brick
after brick; Brick after brick,
Brick after brick
after brick after brick God is building His temple
Brick after brick, He is making it strong
With Christ the sure foundation and His people as the stones
He is building a place He can live
Brick after brick; Brick after brick
Brick after Brick after brick
The Scariest Song
Some say snakes and some say spiders
What strikes terror to your toes?
Some say floods and some say fires
Some say dentist drills or creepy clowns
Climbing up or falling down
But I'll tell you what's the scariest around
Sin–it's the scariest
Sin hurts everyone
Sin–how it hides in us
It's all the wrong we've done
It separates us from our God
Behind these prison walls
Oh, sin is the scariest of all
What's the scariest to you?
Some say living, some say dying
What's the worst thing you can do?
Some say failing when they're trying
Some say getting germs or getting shots
Getting lost or getting caught
But I'll tell you what's the worst thing we have got
Sin–it's the scariest
Sin hurts everyone
Sin–how it hides in us
It's all the wrong we've done
It separates us from our God
Behind these prison walls
Oh, sin is the scariest of all
Since Adam and since Eve sin's spread like a disease
We know that on our own we cannot beat it
But though it seeks to kill, our God is stronger still
And only by His grace can we defeat it
Sin–it's the scariest
Sin hurts everyone
Sin–how it hides in us
It's all the wrong we've done
It separates us from our God
Behind these prison walls
Oh, sin is the scariest of all
Just the Way God Wanted Us to Be
With seas and trees and animals and then He made a man
But Adam he was incomplete, so God gave him a helper, Eve
To carry out His plan
This happy husband and his wife
They showed the world what God is like until they disobeyed
And even though they lost it all we still see fingerprints of God
In everyone He makes
We are the image of the God of all the world
He made us boys, He made us girls
Different pieces of the puzzle joined together perfectly
We are just the way God wanted us to be
We're shades of brown, we're short and tall
But God Himself designed us all unique so we could see
He wants each one to play a part to show the world the Father's heart
To have a family
We are the image of the God of all the world
He made us boys, He made us girls
Different pieces of the puzzle joined together perfectly
We are just the way God wanted us to be
We are the image of the God of all the world
He made us boys, He made us girls
Different pieces of the puzzle joined together perfectly
We are just the way God wanted us to be

One Step at a Time
It seems like it was just yesterday
We had to say we were sorry
And even though we don't want to sin, we fall again every day
It feels like we're pushing a rock that won't move
We want to obey, but it's so hard to do
But if Jesus is Lord, we can be sure
Sin's not in charge anymore
And God's love will lead us
One step at a time as we walk in the light
He's faithful to keep us
One step at a time as He's making us more like Christ
Sin, it camps like an enemy
That's hidden deep down inside us
So, every day we still have to fight
To do what's right, good, and true
But when we grow tired and want to give in
God gives us power to say "No" to sin
He changes our lives and opens our eyes
So we can bring glory to Christ
And God's love will lead us
One step at a time as we walk in the light
He's faithful to keep us
One step at a time as He's making us more like Christ
In Christ Alone (Live)
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when striving cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe.
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save;
Till on that cross as Jesus die,
The wrath of God was satisfied.
For every sin on Him was laid;

Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,

For I am HIs and He is mine,
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
How Majestic - Live
When I see the stars in heaven
You have flung across the sky
What is man that You should love him
Or that he should catch Your eye
Yet You sent Your Son to die
That we might come to find
Our life in Him

O Lord, our Lord
How majestic is Your name
Majestic is Your name
In all the earth
O Lord, our Lord
How majestic is Your name
Majestic is Your name
In all the earth
In all the earth
In all the earth

You are awesome in Your glory
We are sinful and impure
How can we approach the Holy
Who will not one sin endure
Yet You sent Your Son to die
His blood has paid the price
For all our sin
Endless Praises - Live
Look upon this fearful scene
The King of Love nailed to a tree
The Prince of Glory made to bleed
Hear the pardon that He speaks
"Forgive them" is His plea
Where has love like this been seen

Let us lift up endless praises
Let us give Him endless song
Let us lift up endless praises
Let us sing of all He's done
Let us sing of all our God has done

Look upon this wondrous sight
Foul sinners clothed in white
With the righteousness of Christ
All our guilt is washed away
Every debt we owed is paid
How astounding is this grace

A thousand ages is not long enough
To tell the glories of the Son
Forever we will sing
Redemption's song
And of the victory You've won
Greater Love
You are the mighty Warrior, Lord
Who broke the back of hell
Yet not without great loss of blood
And even death itself
You stripped Yourself of glory
To lift me from the mire of sin

Greater love has never been seen
You paid the greatest price
To make us Your redeemed
Greater love has never been known
No other love's so deep
No other love's so sweet as Your love

You are the Prince of Glory, Lord
Majestic, holy King
The fairest of ten thousand, Oh
Why should you notice me
Yet so much tender mercy
For helpless sinners fills your heart
Your Mercy and Kindness
O Lord You are my shepherd
In You I have no needs
You make me rest in green fields
And walk by quiet streams
O Lord You are my shepherd
Your love restores my soul
And for Your name and glory
You show me the way to go

Your mercy and kindness
Pursue me forever
My cup runs over with Your grace
Your mercy and kindness
Pursue me forever
And I'll be with You all my days

O Lord You are my shepherd
Though I walk through death's dark shade
Your rod and staff give comfort
I will not be afraid
O Lord You are my shepherd
A table You have spread
In sight of all my foes, Lord
And You anoint my head
Receive the Glory - Live
Not to us, but to Your name alone
Be all the glory, the glory, forever
For Your faithfulness and steadfast love
Receive the glory, the glory belongs to You

All that we've accomplished You have done for us
And any fruit we harvest is a gift from Your hand
We are only jars of clay that hold a priceless treasure
And we exist to bring You pleasure, O God

Only by Your mercy can we come to You
Though we deserved Your judgment You have called us by name
So we glory in the cross of Christ that made us Yours forever
That joined our lives together to sing
Surrender All - Live
Take all I am, Lord, and all that I cling to
You are my Savior I owe everything to
Take all the treasures that lie in my storehouse
They cannot follow when I enter Your house

So I surrender all to You
I surrender all

Take all my cravings for vain recognition
Fleshly indulgence and worldly ambition
I want so much Lord to make You the focus
To serve You in secret and never be noticed

So I surrender all to You
I surrender all

Take all my hunger for all that's forbidden
Every desire and sin I keep hidden
Search me and know me I want to bring to You
A life that is holy and sanctified through You

So I surrender all to You
I surrender all

So I surrender all to You
I surrender all

So I surrender all to You
I surrender all
God Moves - Live
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform
He plants His footsteps in the sea
And rides upon the storm
Deep in His dark and hidden mines
With never-failing skill
He fashions all His bright designs
And works His sovereign will

So God we trust in You
O God we trust in You

O fearful saints new courage take
The clouds that you now dread
Are big with mercy and will break
In blessings on your head
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense
But trust Him for His grace
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face

So God we trust in You
O God we trust in You
When tears are great
And comforts few
We hope in mercies ever new
We trust in You

God's purposes will ripen fast
Unfolding every hour
The bud may have a bitter taste
But sweet will be the flower
Blind unbelief is sure to err
And scan His work in vain
God is His own interpreter
And He will make it plain

So God we trust in You
O God we trust in You
So God we trust in You
O God we trust in You
When tears are great
And comforts few
We hope in mercies ever new
We trust in You
So God we trust in You
O God we trust in You
So God we trust in You
O God we trust in You
When tears are great
And comforts few
We hope in mercies ever new
We trust in You
Grace Unmeasured - Live
Grace unmeasured, vast and free
That knew me from eternity
That called me out before my birth
To bring You glory on this earth
Grace amazing, pure and deep
That saw me in my misery
That took my curse and owned my blame
So I could bear Your righteous name

Grace paid for my sins
And brought me to life
Grace clothes me with power
To do what is right
Grace will lead me to heaven
Where I'll see Your face
And never cease

To thank You for Your grace

Grace abounding, strong and true
That makes me long to be like You
That turns me from my selfish pride
To love the cross on which You died
Grace unending all my days
You'll give me strength to run this race
And when my years on earth are through
The praise will all belong to You

Grace paid for my sins
And brought me to life
Grace clothes me with power
To do what is right
Grace will lead me to heaven
Where I'll see Your face
And never cease
To thank You for Your grace
Perfect Lamb of God - Live
Hail the perfect Lamb of God
A kingly ransom paid
When You, my Lord, were slain
Love unrivaled here displayed
Calls my heart to praise
The perfect Lamb of God

The light of day was cloaked by night
And heaven closed its eyes
Wrath unspared for countless sins
The guiltless crucified
Hands of kindness driven through
Back on splintered beam
The holy curtain torn in two
Atonement made for me

Insults mock the Son of God
The angels are restrained
But all the cup must be endured
For sinners to be saved
Can grace prevail in such a day
Of scandal and of scorn?
But with a cry "Forgive" You claim
Traitors as Your own

As You drew Your final breath
My debt was satisfied
And love divine in glorious might
Would vanquish death and rise

Words and music by Adam Sacks
Isn't He Good - Live
Your goodness
Found us in the darkness
Rescued us and freed us
Cleansed us from within
You saved us
Freely You forgave us
Counted us as righteous
And heirs with Your own Son

Isn't He good, isn't He kind
Hasn't He blessed us time after time
Isn't He good, all of our days
With endless mercies
And ceaseless grace
Oh let us sing: He is good

Your mercies meet us
With the daybreak
And every breath that we take
Points us to Your grace
Your power
Keeps us till the hour
Every knee will bow and
Worship Christ alone
O God, Our Help in Ages Past - Live
O God, our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Our shelter from the stormy blast
And our eternal home

Under the shadow of Your throne
Your saints have dwelt secure
Sufficient is Your arm alone
And our defense is sure
And our defense is sure

Lord, You have been our dwelling place
In every generation You're our King
Lord, You have crowned our lives with grace
Our humble adoration we will bring
And we sing to You
We sing to You
Beneath the shelter
Of Your wings

Before the towering mountains stood
'Fore the oceans, fields and plains
From everlasting You are God
To endless years the same

Oh a thousand ages in Your sight
Are a fleeting moment gone
One day is like a thousand years
To You, Eternal One
To You, Eternal One
Jesus, Thank You - Live
The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
The agonies of Calvary
You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father's wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

By Your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near
Your enemy You've made Your friend
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father's wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father's wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

Lover of my soul
I want to live for You

Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father's wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You

Lover of my soul
I want to live for You
Always Forgiven - Live
I don't deserve to be Your servant
And how much less to be Your child
Anger and wrath, sure condemnation
Should be my portion, my just reward
Never have seen it, never will know it
Your loving kindness enfolds my life

All You have shown me is
Grace, love and mercy
Now and forever I am Your child
Freely You pour out
Your loving kindness
Father of grace
You welcome me in

All of the sin I have committed
Was placed upon Your righteous Son
And now You see me through His perfection
As if I'd never done any wrong
Always forgiven, always accepted
No fear of judgment before Your throne
His Forever - Live
Jesus, friend of sinners
Loved me 'ere I knew Him
Drew me with His cords of love
Tightly bound me to Him
'Round my heart still closely twined
The ties that none can sever
For I am His and He is mine
Forever and forever

Jesus, friend of sinners
A crown of thorns You wore for me
Bruised for my transgressions
Pierced for my iniquities
The wrath of God that I deserved
Was poured out on the Innocent
He took my place, my soul to save
Now I am His forever

Jesus, friend of sinners
I love to tell the story
Redeeming love has been my theme
And will be when in glory
Not death nor life nor anything
Can ever separate me
O love that will not let me go
Yes, I am His forever
You Are the Way - Live
Dead in transgressions and sins
Without God, without hope in this world
Then the glorious light
Of Your gospel broke in
The Father stood up from His throne
Opened His arms as He called out my name
Grace irresistible drew me
Opened my eyes to see

You are the way
You are the truth
You are the life, Jesus
The only way
The only truth
You are my life, Jesus

You are the source of new life
The giver of every good thing
Withholding nothing
You lavish Your kindness on me
You emptied Yourself, became poor
Humbled and poured out to death
Now highly exalted above all
Your name alone can save
Count It All Joy - Live
Lord I'll count it all joy
When my troubles
Close me in on every side
Lord, I'll count it all joy
When this road of faith
Runs through the darkest night
For I know You're at work in me
Yes I know You'll provide
All the grace I need

You have always been my Rock
I will trust You forever, forever
You have never failed me God
I will trust You forever, forever

Lord I'll count it all joy
When the weight of sorrow
Drives me to my knees
Every heartache and pain
In Your mighty hands
Is forming Christ in me
And I know that Your Word is true
Yes, I know every trial
Will only prove

Who can separate us
From You and Your great love
God's Great Family
When the Father made us
He knew we'd run from Him
And try to hide our sin
But He wanted to save us
His own were on His heart
Before He made the stars

Oh, oh, no one is good, not even one
But God can make us daughters
God can make us sons
Jesus paid the price
When He offered up His life
So we could be part of God's great family

When the Father draws us
It's like a magnet's pull
He's irresistible
When the Spirit calls us
He brings the dead to life
He gives the blind new eyes

Oh, oh, no one is good, not even one
But God can make us daughters
God can make us sons
Jesus paid the price
When He offered up His life
So we could be part of God's great family

When He calls, when He draws
We are His forever
He will never let you go
He will never let you go

When He calls, when He draws
We are His forever
He will never let you go
He will never let you go

Oh, oh, no one is good, not even one
But God can make us daughters
God can make us sons
Jesus paid the price
When He offered up His life
So we could be part of God's great family

(God's great family)
The One who draws us (God's great family)
Calls us into his family (God's great family)
He's irresistible (God's great family)
And we love Him, 'cause He loved us first (God's great family)
In His family (God's great family)
