11	A man armed with a machete has forced his way into the rural home of Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto after wounding a police guard, police say.	0
12	Mr Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time.	0
13	Specialist troops had been deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, police said.	0
14	Earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr Ruto's home.	0
15	In circumstances that are yet unclear, he hit an officer on duty with a machete and managed to enter the farm complex, National Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said in a statement.	0
16	There were also reports of gunfire.	0
17	The wounded police officer was in a stable condition, police said.	0
18	The incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative and regional elections.	0
19	The deputy president had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in the town of Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta.	0
20	Mr Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month.	0
21	While Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left more than 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes.	0
22	However, experts say they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote.	0
23	Four people have been arrested after counter-terrorism police raided homes across Sydney.	0
24	Well…	0
25	Audio is giving video a run for its money.	0
26	Video’s older sibling is coming back into action after a successful stint, way back when buying individual songs and albums on iTunes was actually a thing.	0
27	I continue to apologise to my mother for finding approx 79 pence charged on her account every few weeks, normally spent on S Club 7’s latest hit - only to be played on repeat, driven into the ground, and subsequently deleted from both my songlist and wider life.	0
28	Apparently print advertising’s coming back, too.	0
29	But that’s a story for another day.	0
30	But the podcast never died, because the staunch podcast subscribers lived on — and now they’re laughing.	0
31	Even better, though, is that the staunch podcast creators are laughing even harder.	0
32	Podcasts are soaring, so jump back on board.	0
33	Why tho?	0
34	Here are just some of the reasons for choosing to listen:	0
35	A few reasons:	0
36	It’s also worth mentioning that it’s non-exclusive.	0
37	There’s no discrimination within the podcast world — startups and Fortune 500s, eat your hearts out.	0
38	Personally, I listen to podcasts and I watch videos.	0
39	And I’m sure the majority do.	0
40	But I’m much more likely to choose a podcast for two different scenarios:	0
41	Don’t misunderstand: I know I’m supposed to care about data.	0
42	I’m supposed to end that opening sentence by saying, “but I’m working hard to improve my analytical chops.”	0
43	But the truth is, I’m really not.	0
44	Instead, I’m working hard to improve my creative chops.	0
45	It’s what I love.	0
46	It’s what I was put on this earth to do.	0
47	I aspire to create things that make you feel stuff and think stuff and want to spend more time with more of that stuff.	0
48	Now, I’m no fool.	0
49	I know I’ll look far better if I claim that I’m data-driven.	0
50	After all, I’ve worked for online startups and tech companies my entire career.	0
51	We’re the crowd responsible for the data-first ways currently permeating even the most analytics-agnostic fields.	0
52	I know I’m supposed to say I care a ton about data.	0
53	But, well … I just don’t.	0
54	We pretend to care.	0
55	But we don’t really care.	0
56	We really care about our craft.	0
57	We really care about what our intuition is urging us to try.	0
58	We really care about making things others like — nay, love.	0
59	And as it just so happens, this is the skill that many businesses are starting to realize they need but can’t often find.	0
60	Not caring about data seems insane (dare I say, unthinkable), but it’s made us valuable to companies and clients and customers all the same.	0
61	Because rather than get 1.2x the results through optimization, we strive for 10x the results through creation.	0
62	We aim high.	0
63	We’re comfortable doing the crazy.	0
64	We’re major players in a game that consumers are winning because they have all the choice.	0
65	I’ll confess: the problem isn’t really “numbers.” The problem isn’t even in starting with the numbers.	0
66	(Sometimes, it’s good to start with data.	0
67	Sometimes, not.)	0
68	Instead, the problem lies in how most organizations use those numbers: as sources of answers.	0
69	The data says X, so let’s do X.	0
70	Rather than find a deeper insight, ask questions, sit with customers, or unleash the creative firepower of the team … we default to the conventional wisdom or the past precedent.	0
71	So, no, we don’t care about data — not the way most companies interpret data.	0
72	We care about insights, but unless we’re speaking plain English, we’re not talking about insights just yet.	0
73	(Note: We’d be fine with interpretive dance, too, just … don’t do the worm.)	0
74	We don’t care so much about the numbers.	0
75	To us, this is about making something others are afraid to say out loud in the working world: art.	0
76	That’s a scary word in our space.	0
77	Why?	0
78	Sounds a whole lot like the stuff we’re supposed to be making for work.	0
79	So what do we care about?	0
80	People.	0
81	Us.	0
82	You.	0
83	The audience.	0
84	People hold the answer, always.	0
85	Your technology is there to amplify your people.	0
86	Your analytics is there to track other people.	0
87	This is a game of unleashing the very best in your people, and finding solutions to the very worst in the people you wish to serve.	0
88	It’s never about the wand.	0
89	It’s always the wizard that holds the true power.	0
90	And we, the creative people, aspire to unleash our full potential.	0
91	We don’t do so by caring about data.	0
92	We do so by caring about making great art.	0
93	And our leading indicator of the art we should make is the overlap between what WE want to create (intuition) and what others react emotionally to consuming (qualitative feedback).	0
94	That is the shift from “acting like a publisher” (hitting “publish” more often, more quickly) to aspiring to be The Washington Post of our niche … the ESPN of our space … or “The Daily Show” of our industry.	0
95	So, care about data?	0
96	No thank you.	0
97	Gasp and clutch your pearls all you want.	0
98	“But, but you’re being too emotional here!	0
99	But, but SEO is a great tool that can — and, and everyone on Medium is writing about — but we have monthly metrics to — and we have proof and processes and science…”	0
100	No, shhh-shhh, there-there.	0
101	You’re not listening.	0
102	See, I know all that.	0
103	I know I should care.	0
104	But all I care about … is making you feel.	0
105	Does your data get me there?	0
106	Great, tell me how.	0
107	Does my intuition get me there?	0
108	11 outta 10 times it does.	0
109	In a world where others barely spend time with anything, I’m here to acquire and retain minutes or hours, not seconds.	0
110	I’m here to trigger emotional responses, not clicks.	0
111	I’m here to avoid creating more down-the-fairway, blend-into-the-noise, just-do-that-thing-again junk … because “that’s the best practice.”	0
112	Buy.	0
113	BUY: Hire people not because their resumes fit some kind of mold but precisely because their portfolios break it.	0
114	BUY: Question the experts and the best practice.	0
115	Look, I know everything in this article sounds utterly insane.	0
116	I know that.	0
117	I do.	0
118	I’m no dummy.	0
119	My brain is fighting against my gut every day, urging me to spend more time in Google Analytics, and screaming at me to click that link shared by that expert.	0
120	I could be missing THE best way to do my work!	0
121	But what if … my gut is right?	0
122	What if I actually possessed this ability to arrive at the idea or the answer more quickly and with more confidence?	0
123	What if that skill could be honed over time, getting more and more accurate as it also gets faster?	0
124	Because maybe the idea that art isn’t good business is actually the wrong idea.	0
125	Maybe real artists ship more and better work than anyone else thinks possible, just because they don’t see what the artist sees — because maybe they don’t care about what the artist cares about.	0
126	Maybe.	0
127	I don’t know for sure.	0
128	But something is telling me I’m right.	0
129	So I confess, with you as my witness: I don’t care too much about the numbers.	0
130	But I’m utterly obsessed with producing the things that produce the numbers.	0

139	As followers of Jesus, we have chosen the side of good over evil.	0
140	Nowhere is this clearer than in regions of the world where persecution is the costly price Christians pay for proclaiming the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ — places, for instance, where ISIS is ruthlessly executing our brothers and sisters in the faith.	0
141	While the battle with evil certainly has physical manifestations, the deeper and more important war is spiritual and internal.	0
142	When evil attacks, we cry out in prayer for God to help us.	1
143	And what we ask God for tells us a lot about what we really want, and in what we hope.	0
144	Turn, O Lord, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love.	0
145	(Psalm 6:4)	0
146	“My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.” (Matthew 26:39)	0
147	“God, save me!” is a very normal and understandable response to the evil of persecution.	0
148	We hear it from psalmists and in the first half of Jesus’s prayer in the garden before his crucifixion.	1
149	If my family or I were in prison, we would want scores of people to pray this prayer on our behalf.	1
150	I would certainly pray this prayer myself.	1
151	Yet we need to remember that it’s only half of what Jesus prayed in Matthew 26:39, because we can quickly move to praying,	1
152	May his days be few; may another take his office!	0
153	May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow!	0
154	May his children wander about and beg, seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit!	0
155	May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!	0
156	(Psalm 109:8–11)	0
157	“God, punish them” is also a normal response to the evil of persecution.	0
158	Again, we hear this prayer in the Psalms, but it is not how the New Testament teaches us to pray.	1
159	We in the West tend to see persecution as a violation of our human rights, and so we expect and demand from God and governments both rescue and retribution from something God may actually be using for his glory, our spiritual growth, and the spread of the gospel.	0
160	In other words, sometimes God needs Joseph in Pharaoh’s prison for the salvation of Egypt and the Jews in Egypt.	0
161	This is when we must pray the second half of Jesus’s garden prayer, “Not as I will, but as you will” (Matthew 26:39).	1
162	This is important, because calling on God to punish our enemies can easily be our failure to love them as Christ loved us.	0
163	Followers of Jesus must press beyond these first two prayerful responses to evil and join Jesus and Stephen in praying,	1
164	“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:34)	0
165	“Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” (Acts 7:60)	0
166	“Father, forgive them” recognizes that followers of Jesus see themselves both as targets of satanic attack, yet still victorious in their Savior.	0
167	Both Jesus, while hanging on the cross, and Stephen, while being crushed by stones, viewed their persecutors as victims in need of forgiveness, as well as individuals responsible for their sinful actions.	0
168	This response does not come easy, we all know.	0
169	Seeking forgiveness for one’s enemies is counterintuitive, unpopular, and often seen as weakness, even sometimes by Christians.	0
170	In certain streams of the church, it seems acceptable for Christians to say hostile and even hateful things about Muslims.	0
171	This is a tragic distortion of the gospel.	0
172	The church’s greatness cannot be wrapped up with its nation’s greatness.	0
173	The church is not measured by the size of its country’s political, military, or economic power, or its form of government.	0
174	The church’s greatness is measured by its love, which is the sacrificial, dying enemy-love of Calvary (John 13:35; Matthew 5:44; Romans 5:8).	0
175	To respond to evil with prayers like Jesus’s and Stephen’s requires a devotion to “a better country” (Hebrews 11:16), and a faith rooted in the promise that even the worst persecution cannot touch our indestructible lives (Luke 21:16–19; John 11:25–26).	0
176	Forgiving our enemies displays Christlike love in a world out for revenge.	0
177	And the more we grow in Christlike faith and love, the more we will pray the very dangerous prayer,	1
178	“Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.” (Matthew 6:12)	0
179	This is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray.	1
180	Is there a more dangerous prayer for our soul?	1
181	Do we really embrace its implication — that whether or not we forgive our enemies, including our persecutors, reveals whether our souls are saved from or still under God’s wrath (Matthew 6:15)?	0
182	In a world governed by the ancient ethic of “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,” it’s quite popular to repay “evil for evil” (Matthew 5:38–39; Romans 12:17).	0
183	But living by the Christian ethic of “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” is simply otherworldly (Matthew 5:44).	1
184	It demands that we be defined by heaven on earth.	0
185	Living the Lord’s Prayer in the face of hostility and persecution might be the most dangerous thing we ever attempt.	1
186	The more we see our enemies as those in desperate need of God’s grace, and the more we are willing to forgive as God forgives us, the more free we’ll be to embrace all the possible implications as we pray,	1
187	“Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you.” (John 17:1)	0
188	“Father, glorify yourself” is what Jesus prayed just hours before the cross.	1
189	He fully trusted his Father, which made him free and bold to walk full of faith into the jaws of persecution.	0
190	And when we pray like this, it shows that our faith is not in governments or international human-rights declarations, but in God.	1
191	Such profound trust in God makes us as free to share Christ in Saudi Arabia as we are in South Dakota.	0
192	We are as free to share our faith in North Korea as in North Carolina.	0
193	No one can stop us from stepping out of airplanes, buses, and cars and proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ anywhere.	0
194	Persecutors can certainly punish us for sharing our faith, but by doing so they end up helping us proclaim it all the more!	0
195	If we don’t shrink back, if we don’t exit the fight at the entry-level prayers of “God, save me” and “God, punish them,” but press on to seeking our enemies’ forgiveness and God’s glory, we will know the joy of bearing spiritual fruit and seeing the kingdom come.	0
196	We will live in freedom — not political freedom, but gospel freedom (John 8:32; Galatians 5:1).	0
197	Can we pray with Jesus, “Father, whatever it takes, glorify your Son through me today, that the Son and I may glorify you”?	1
198	When ISIS or some other evil force attacks again, we will pray.	1
199	The question is, what will we pray?	1
200	When push comes to literal shove, what do we really want?	0
201	Do we only want deliverance?	0
202	Or do we want God’s glory to be revealed and our enemies to experience God’s grace even more than we want to escape from pain?	0
203	None of us likely can answer those questions as we would like.	0
204	But let’s grow into God’s grace, and into these prayers, especially the last three, by praying them now, even if there is no threat of persecution.	1
205	For evil will attack at some point, and we want to be as ready as possible if the glory of God, the eternal good of others, and the spread of the gospel require our lives or the lives of those we love.	0

214	You will not endure as a Christian without powerful, effective prayer.	1
215	That might be a frightening thought at first blush.	0
216	If you’re like me, your prayer life feels inadequate.	1
217	You feel more like the faltering father of the demon-possessed boy (Mark 9:24) than a faith-filled Elijah (James 5:17–18).	0
218	But that does not mean powerful, effective prayer for your needs does not exist.	1
219	Because of our weakness in this period between Jesus’s first and second comings, the Father has sent us another Helper.	0
220	Now, when we have no idea what to pray for, he steps in:	1
221	Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness.	0
222	For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.	1
223	(Romans 8:26)	0
224	The way the Spirit helps us is surprising.	0
225	If we don’t know what to pray for, you’d expect the Holy Spirit would help by, you know, telling us what to pray for.	1
226	If not that, perhaps he would help us understand God’s plans in Scripture better, or give us prophetic words about what he’s doing.	0
227	But instead, “the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.” The Holy Spirit constantly intercedes for us.	1
228	To intercede, of course, means to intervene in someone else’s cause — to make an appeal on someone else’s behalf.	0
229	I remember taking my wife to a Starbucks in Fairfax, Virginia when we were dating.	0
230	I was waiting with my signal ticking, ready to take a spot being vacated, when a car swooped in from the other direction and stole my spot.	0
231	I was annoyed, of course, but being a polite Canadian, I sighed and prepared to find another spot.	0
232	But two strangers sitting outside saw this injustice go down, and they were outraged.	0
233	They leaped up and yelled at the driver who had stolen my spot.	0
234	The sheer weight of their moral indignation forced the driver to screech off in humiliation while they waved me into my rightful possession.	0
235	My only role in all of this was merely to sit there with my mouth open.	0
236	These strangers had interceded for me not by giving me tips and pointers for how to handle the situation, but by jumping in and taking care of it themselves.	0
237	All I had to do was drive into the empty spot.	0
238	Surely the Spirit does help us to pray more effectively, but that’s not what Romans 8:26 is about.	1
239	Paul says the Spirit “intercedes for us,” which means there’s a direct conversation between the Spirit and the Father in which we are discussed, but do not participate.	1
240	Imagine the heavenly prayer meeting.	0
241	It goes on for you and me and the whole church of God continually.	0
242	The exalted Son, seated at his Father’s right hand, powerfully pleads our case, bringing forth his blood and righteousness (indeed, his very person) on our behalf (Romans 8:34).	0
243	He defends us from all the accusations and condemnation of the evil one.	0
244	And because the Father loves his Son, every promise is “Yes and Amen” in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20).	0
245	As if that were not grace enough, the Holy Spirit is also present, on speakerphone, as it were.	0
246	He’s calling directly from our hearts, where he not only knows our every need more intimately than do we ourselves, but he also gazes into the depths of the Father’s will with complete clarity.	0
247	Since all of his requests are perfectly in line with that will, and everything for which he asks echoes the requests of the beloved Son, his continual requests are continually granted.	1
248	More than that, the Helper does not plead for us with disinterested duty; he intercedes with deep groans.	1
249	The Spirit of God groans right alongside us and the whole creation as we wait for our full redemption (Romans 8:22–26).	0
250	Here we teeter on the edge of something mysterious and glorious.	0
251	The Bible only mentions this ministry of the Spirit here.	0
252	For a brief moment the curtain is pulled back, and we catch a glimpse of our great Friend and Helper hard at work on our behalf.	0
253	It’s been going on since you became a Christian, and it will go on until you die or Christ returns.	0
254	The Helper carries the burden along with you, even taking most of it upon his shoulders.	0
255	However often or earnestly you pray, the Spirit intercedes on your behalf more often and more earnestly.	1
256	No matter how intensely you groan in the body, the Holy Spirit groans yet more intensely on your behalf.	1
257	Do you long to be free from sickness and decay (Romans 8:20–21)?	0
258	The Holy Spirit longs for it, too.	0
259	Do you wait eagerly for the full manifestation of your sonship (Romans 8:23)?	0
260	The Holy Spirit waits for it even more eagerly.	0
261	Do you join with the saints in crying out, “Come, Lord Jesus” (Revelation 22:20)?	0
262	The church’s cry is only the echo of the Spirit’s passionate desire to glorify the Son who sent him.	0
263	And when you don’t know what to pray, or feel too overwhelmed to let out more than a groan, the Spirit is interceding for you with the exact requests you need.	1
264	Left to our own blundering devices, the riches available to us in Christ would rust away unused.	0
265	But with the prayers of our Helper, we receive everything we need when we need it.	1
266	You will not endure to the end without powerful, effective prayer.	1
267	And that is exactly what you have in the Holy Spirit — your interceder and your Helper.	0

276	“You do not have, because you do not ask” (James 4:2).	1
277	How much enjoyment of God’s presence and experience of his power for mission are we missing out on because we do not ask God for them?	1
278	Jesus also says we do not have because we ask with such little faith (Matthew 17:19–20).	1
279	How much enjoyment of God’s presence and experience of his power for mission are we missing out on because our expectation is so small that prayer will result in anything?	1
280	Jesus also says we do not have, because we do not ask long enough (Luke 11:5–13).	1
281	All over the Bible we see, not in great detail but in sufficient detail, that we are involved in a great cosmic battle and that the prayers of the saints are crucial to the advancement of the kingdom of God (see Daniel 10:12–14 and Ephesians 6:18).	1
282	We don’t need to know how it all works; we just need to know it does.	0
283	The testimony of Scripture and church history is that great, Spirit-empowered, Great Commission-fulfilling works of God are preceded, carried, and prolonged by the fervent, persistent, prevailing prayers of the saints.	1
284	When prayer dissipates, spiritual power dissipates.	1
285	How much enjoyment of God’s presence and experience of his power for mission are we missing out on because we simply don’t ask long enough?	1
286	When Jesus encouraged us “always to pray and not lose heart” (Luke 18:1), he wasn’t telling us to do something that he himself didn’t need to do.	1
287	Jesus knew from his own human experience that he needed to ask his Father for everything, to ask him in faith, and at times to persevere in prayer until the breakthrough came.	1
288	In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.	1
289	(Hebrews 5:7)	1
290	This text gives us unique insight not so much into what Jesus prayed, but into how Jesus prayed.	1
291	And it has something to say to us about how we should pray.	1
292	First, let it hit you that Jesus prayed.	1
293	“In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving [he let his] requests be made known to God” (Philippians 4:6).	1
294	Hebrews 5:7 gives us a glimpse of the glory of Christ’s humility in his incarnation.	1
295	We see some of what it meant for him to empty himself by becoming human and taking the form of a servant (Philippians 2:7).	0
296	In his fully divine nature, Jesus had continual communion with his Father.	1
297	But in his fully human nature, he had to pray to the Father just like we do.	1
298	That’s why “he would withdraw to desolate places and pray” (Luke 5:16), sometimes praying entire nights (Luke 6:12).	1
299	He knew he could do nothing on his own and was completely dependent on the Father (John 5:19).	0
300	If Jesus had to pray, and pray a lot, so do we.	1
301	And he prayed “with loud cries and tears.” Complete dependence on God was not merely an abstract theological concept for Jesus; it was a desperate, experiential reality.	1
302	This verse isn’t referring only to Gethsemane, because Jesus prayed this way “in the days of his flesh.” During Jesus’s human experience on earth, he repeatedly, and likely regularly, prayed with loud cries and tears.	1
303	Why was he moved to pray so passionately?	1
304	He was keenly aware that heaven and hell were real outcomes for real souls as a result of his mission.	0
305	He knew there were demonized persons needing deliverance, sick needing healing, particular gospel truths needing to be proclaimed at particular times in particular places for particular persons.	0
306	He and his disciples were also usually living hand-to-mouth on a daily basis.	0
307	He also had the forces of hell constantly trying to destroy him, his disciples, and his mission.	0
308	We know the spiritual warfare that erupts whenever we attempt real, meaningful kingdom labor.	0
309	Imagine what it was like for Jesus.	0
310	And, of course, the cross was always looming before him, growing larger as the day drew nearer.	0
311	He knew that when he offered himself as a sacrifice, and absorbed the full wrath of God for the sins of all who would believe in him, and died (John 3:16), only the Father “was able to save him from death.”	0
312	Jesus knew the nature of his freely chosen human helplessness made him dependent on the Father for all these things.	0
313	So, he prayed with loud cries and tears out of his desperate human need for his Father’s help.	1
314	We also desperately need the Father’s help in all these things, too, including preparing for our own death, through which we trust him to deliver us.	0
315	Would you have expected the author of Hebrews to say that Jesus “was heard because of his reverence”?	0
316	Wouldn’t we have expected, Jesus was heard because he was God’s Son?	0
317	Jesus had positional access to the Father, and in him so do we.	0
318	But the author didn’t say that.	0
319	He chose “reverence.” Why?	0
320	Reverence is a holy fear of God.	0
321	Now, this is astonishing: God the Son regards God the Father with an appropriate holy fear.	0
322	The Son is not afraid of the Father’s judgment.	0
323	He simply has the appropriate regard of the Father’s omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and eternal greatness.	0
324	Terror is what persons experience when they truly encounter God and yet have no access to him as a Father.	0
325	Reverence is what persons experience when they have free access to the Father as his children — when they know the Father, and believe what the Father says.	0
326	Reverence isn’t a feigned respectful or formal demeanor we put on when we pray to God that looks quite different from the rest of the way we live and talk.	1
327	Persons who truly revere God do so all the time.	0
328	When you hear them pray, it doesn’t sound much different than the way they usually talk.	1
329	You can just tell they believe they are speaking to God himself.	1
330	Their reverence enables them to approach him like the loving Father that he is.	0
331	God’s throne is a throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16).	0
332	So, a reverent child of God feels the freedom to come to him in desperate need, even with loud cries and tears, because God is honored when that child comes to him in desperate faith.	1
333	If we lack reverence for God, it shows up in the way we live and in the way we pray.	1
334	These are indicators that we do not know him like he wants us to, and therefore our faith in him is very small, which is likely why we aren’t realizing more answered prayer.	1
335	If this is true about us, let’s forget trying to guilt ourselves into praying more, except to allow our guilt to drive us to repentance.	0
336	Rather, let’s note how Jesus prayed and pray like him!	1
337	Jesus prayed because he knew the extent of his human need.	1
338	He prayed in reverential faith because he believed God and loved him with all his being.	1
339	And he persisted and prevailed in prayer, sometimes praying with loud cries and tears, because he knew what he was up against, the strongholds imprisoning people, and the cost of his mission.	1
340	He prayed, and he was heard.	1
341	We only pray when, like Jesus, we are aware of our real need.	1
342	The greater this awareness is, the greater our sense of desperation for God’s help.	0
343	And the greater our desperation for God, the more we will pray.	1
344	And the more we will pray, the more we will experience the joy of his presence and his power for mission.	1
345	That’s why God wants us to pray like Jesus.	1
346	He wants us to come to him.	0
347	His great invitation to us is to come and ask, to ask in faith, and to keep asking in faith until we receive his answer.	1
348	Do not lose heart; do not give up; pray, even with loud cries and tears, until God grants the breakthrough you seek.	1
