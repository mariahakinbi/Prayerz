556	The Judge of every sinner sent Christ to Calvary
557	To prepare a place for me
558	Judgment should be given
559	For this guilt upon my head
560	But the Father of all glory crushed His Son instead

562	You prepared a place for me
563	Blessed be, blessed be
564	My God and Savior, You've shown me favor
565	And prepared a place for me
566	Father, in the moment

570	You prepared a place for me
571	You Made Us Your Own

586	We draw near You now with confidence
587	For all our fears are gone
588	And when Christ our King returns
589	We'll meet saints we've never known
590	And forever we will be amazed
591	That You made us Your own
592	Undying Love
593	My ears had heard of You, now I have seen
594	This bitter sweetness in Your agony
595	My heart was far from You, but You drew me near
596	With loving kindness dried every tear
597	And I can see You
598	Bearing all my shame on the cross
599	"I can hear You cry out, ""It is done"""
600	O Jesus, Your sacrifice was more than enough
601	In Your death I see undying love
602	My heart is broken and I'm down on my knees
603	To see my Savior suffering for me
604	But You descended, lifting me up
605	Washing my feet, filling my cup
606	We Sing
607	We've come together in Your name
608	We've come together to proclaim
609	How great You are
610	Once we were going our own ways
611	Now we're a people for Your praise
612	How great You are
613	We sing as sons and daughters
614	Sing to God our Father
615	All because of Jesus
616	We sing, His blood has bought us
617	Sing, Your mercy called us
618	All because of Jesus we sing
619	Jesus, You're powerful to save
620	Jesus, You've risen from the grave
621	How great You are
622	Your blood gave us peace with God
623	Your love has broken down our walls
624	How great You are
625	By grace we have been saved
626	To be Your dwelling place
627	You took our curse and made us one
628	It's nothing we could do
629	Our only boast is You
630	So we rejoice in what You've done
631	You Gave Your Son
632	Father, compassionate and tender
633	Your ears are ever open to my prayers
634	Father, You feed the crying ravens
635	You daily lift the burdens that I bear
636	So I will thank You for Your mercy
637	You gave Your Son
638	Righteous One for the defiled
639	You gave Your Son
640	By His blood we're reconciled
641	To our God
642	Father, You know that I grow weary
643	I need You to draw near me and be my strength
644	Father, I long to know Your presence
645	For You're the joy of heaven and my King
646	So I will thank You for Your mercy
647	Whom have I in heaven but You
648	And none on earth compares with You
649	Precious Children
650	Broken and defiled
651	Clinging to our filth
652	We gloried in our shame
653	Running far from You
654	Still Your mercy sought and saved us
655	Hallelujah
656	We belong to You
657	You have washed our stains
658	And have raised us up with Christ
659	Precious children in Your eyes
660	You gave Your only Son
661	Your joy and Your delight
662	You nailed Him to the cross
663	You crushed Him for our sin
664	How could you love us like You love Him
665	The Greatest of All
666	The greatest of all transactions
667	The costliest purchase price
668	Father, Your Son's atoning death
669	Was given in payment for mine
670	To buy me back from slavery
671	To set me free from my chains
672	Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it
673	Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
674	Redeemed through Your infinite mercy
675	Your child forever I am
676	Now I'll never know Your judgment
677	You ransomed and saved my soul
678	Jesus, Your death and Yours alone
679	Has canceled the debt that I owed
680	You satisfied the law's demand
681	And new life's been given to me
682	God Delights In You
683	Calling every daughter
684	Calling every son
685	All who've been adopted
686	Through a sacrifice of love
687	There's no need for you to fear
688	Your debts have all been cleared
689	Calling all the downcast
690	Who feel like they're alone
691	Anyone who's longing
692	For a family of their own
693	God's prepared a place for you
694	He's calling you to
695	Come and sing, come and dance
696	The Father's singing over you
697	Come rejoice and be glad
698	For God delights in you, in you
699	Calling all who've wandered
700	Gone off on their own
701	Anyone who wonders
702	If they're welcome back at home
703	The God of grace makes all things new
704	He's calling you to
705	You chose us to be the objects of Your love
706	In spite of all we have done
707	You gave Your beloved Son to die for us
708	To make us daughters and sons
709	Completely Done
710	What reason have I to doubt
711	Why would I dwell in fear
712	When all I have known is grace
713	My future in Christ is clear
714	My sins have been paid in full
715	There's no condemnation here
716	I live in the good of this
717	My Father has brought me near
718	I'm leaving my fears behind me now
719	The old is gone, the new has come
720	What You complete is completely done
721	We're heirs with Christ, the victory won
722	What You complete is completely done
723	I don't know what lies ahead
724	What if I fail again
725	You are my confidence
726	You'll keep me to the end
727	I'm leaving my fears behind me now
728	The old is gone, the new has come
729	What You complete is completely done
730	We're heirs with Christ, the victory won
731	What You complete is completely done
732	The old is gone, the new has come
733	The Prodigal
734	You held out Your arms, I walked away
735	Insolent, I spurned Your face
736	Squandering the gifts You gave to me
737	Holding close forbidden things
738	Destitute, a rebel still, a fool in all my pride
739	The world I once enjoyed is death to me
740	No joy, no hope, no life
741	Where now are the friends that I had bought
742	Gone with every penny lost
743	What hope could there be for such as I
744	Sold out to a world of lies
745	Oh to see Your face again, it seems so distant now
746	Could it be that You would take me back
747	A servant in Your house
748	You held out Your arms, I see them still
749	You never left, You never will
750	Running to embrace me, now I know
751	Your cords of love will always hold
752	Mercy's robe, a ring of grace
753	Such favor undeserved
754	You sing over me and celebrate
755	The rebel now Your child
756	Who Made Me to Know You
757	Who made me to know You, but You
758	When dead in sin You gave me new life
759	Now my heart is filled with love for You, Jesus
760	Father, thank You for Your Spirit's work in me
761	For opening my eyes to the Christ of Calvary
762	Jesus, You gave Your life in exchange for mine
763	Now I will live for You who died, Jesus
764	You placed a crown of grace on my head
765	You covered me in robes of righteousness
766	Forever I will always be Yours, Jesus
767	In You Alone
768	You spoke and time began
769	Light dawned at Your command
770	And by Your Word the earth began to move
771	Carved mountains with Your hands
772	Breathed life into all men
773	You made it all and saw that it was good
774	There is no rival to You, O God
775	All kings and idols will one day fall
776	Who among the gods is like You?
777	Who could ever measure
778	All You've done, O God?
779	Creator, Sustainer, Merciful Savior
780	Forever on Your throne,
781	You stand alone
782	Your Spirit gave the Law
783	In kindness to us all
784	And though we never kept it, You were true
785	Lawmaker, You have saved
786	Lawbreakers from the grave
787	And by Your Son our guilt has been removed
788	Your endless glory shines through Your Son
789	There is no story of greater love
790	Who among the gods is like You?
791	Who could ever measure

798	Who could ever measure
799	All You've done, O God?
800	Creator, Sustainer, Merciful Savior
801	Forever on Your throne,
802	You stand alone
803	At the Foot of the Cross
804	Beneath the Cross of Jesus
805	Lord, I would spend my days
806	In the shadow of the One
807	Who ransomed me
808	May I not become familiar
809	With its marvelous good news
810	But live my life with it
811	Always in my view
812	At the foot of the Cross
813	Lord, I bow down and worship
814	Overcome by so great a love
815	At the foot of the Cross

1045	We resolve to know
1046	Nothing else but Jesus Christ

1048	To come to God by grace alone
1049	Through faith alone in His blood, spilled for us
1050	Singing soli Deo gloria

1070	To God alone be glory
1071	To God alone be glory
1072	In Jesus Christ
1073	Jesus, My Only Hope
1074	Our mouths were open graves
1075	Full of broken vows we made
1076	Our hearts ran wild
1077	Our tongues could not be tamed
1078	What darkness had concealed
1079	Your law has now revealed
1080	Our guilt was great
1081	Our bitter fate was sealed
1082	Our only hope
1083	Our only hope is You, Lord
1084	Our only hope
1085	Our only hope is You
1086	Though hypocrites and fools
1087	You draw us to the truth
1088	For Your own glory

1090	Our only hope
1091	Our only hope is You, Lord
1092	Our only hope
1093	Our only hope is You, Lord
1094	Thes we had burned You have restored
1095	You gave us hope when there was none before
1096	You paid the debt that we could not afford
1097	And cast away our guilt forevermore
1098	So, when our days are through
1099	Our hope will rest in You
1100	For we can trust
1101	Your promises are true
1102	Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me
1103	Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
1104	Let me hide myself in Thee;
1105	Let the water and the blood,
1106	From Thy wounded side which flowed,
1107	Be of sin the double cure;
1108	Save from wrath and make me pure.
1109	While I draw this fleeting breath,
1110	When mine eyes shall close in death,
1111	When I soar to worlds unknown,
1112	See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
1113	Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
1114	Let me hide myself in Thee.
1115	I Will Glory In My Redeemer
1116	I will glory in my Redeemer
1117	Whose priceless blood has ransomed me
1118	Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
1119	And hung Him on that judgment tree
1120	I will glory in my Redeemer
1121	Who crushed the power of sin and death
1122	My only Savior before the holy Judge
1123	The Lamb who is my righteousness
1124	The Lamb who is my righteousness
1125	I will glory in my Redeemer
1126	My life He bought, my love He owns
1127	I have no longings for another
1128	I'm satisfied in Him alone
1129	I will glory in my Redeemer
1130	His faithfulness my standing place
1131	Though foes are mighty and rush upon me
1132	My feet are firm, held by His grace
1133	My feet are firm, held by His grace
1134	I will glory in my Redeemer
1135	Who carries me on eagles' wings
1136	He crowns my life with lovingkindness
1137	His triumph song I'll ever sing
1138	I will glory in my Redeemer
1139	Who waits for me at gates of gold
1140	And when He calls me, it will be paradise
1141	His face forever to behold
1142	I will glory in my Redeemer
1143	Who waits for me at gates of gold
1144	And when He calls me, it will be paradise
1145	His face forever to behold
1146	His face forever to behold
1147	His face forever to behold
1148	The Look
1149	I saw one hanging on a tree
1150	In agony and blood
1151	Who fixed His loving eyes on me
1152	As near His cross I stood
1153	And never till my dying breath
1154	Will I forget that look
1155	It seemed to charge me with His death
1156	Though not a word He spoke
1157	My conscience felt and owned the guilt
1158	And plunged me in despair
1159	I saw my sins His blood had spilt
1160	And helped to nail Him there
1161	But with a second look He said
1162	"I freely all forgive
This blood is for your ransom paid
I died that you might live"
1163	Forever etched upon my mind
1164	Is the look of Him who died
1165	The Lamb I crucified
1166	And now my life will sing the praise
1167	Of pure atoning grace
1168	That looked on me and gladly took my place
1169	Thus while His death my sin displays
1170	For all the world to view
1171	Such is the mystery of grace
1172	It seals my pardon too
1173	With pleasing grief and mournful joy
1174	My spirit now is filled
1175	That I should such a life destroy
1176	Yet live by Him I killed
1177	Forever etched upon my mind
1178	Is the look of Him who died
1179	The Lamb I crucified
1180	And now my life will sing the praise
1181	Of pure atoning grace
1182	That looked on me and gladly took my place
1183	Forever etched upon my mind
1184	Is the look of Him who died
1185	The Lamb I crucified
1186	And now my life will sing the praise
1187	Of pure atoning grace
1188	That looked on me and gladly took my place
1189	Like a River Glorious
1190	Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace
1191	Over all victorious in its bright increase
1192	Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day
1193	Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way
1194	Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest
1195	Finding as He promised
1196	Perfect peace and rest
1197	Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand
1198	Never foe can follow, never traitor stand
1199	Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care
1200	Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there
1201	Every joy or trial falleth from above
1202	Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love
1203	We may trust Him fully all for us to do
1204	They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true
1205	Before the Throne
1206	Before the throne of God above
1207	I have a strong and perfect plea
1208	A great High Priest whose name is love
1209	Who ever lives and pleads for me
1210	My name is graven on His hands
1211	My name is written on His heart
1212	I know that while in heav'n He stands
1213	No tongue can bid me thence depart
1214	No tongue can bid me thence depart
1215	When Satan tempts me to despair
1216	And tells me of the guilt within
1217	Upward I look and see Him there
1218	Who made an end of all my sin
1219	Because the sinless Savior died
1220	My sinful soul is counted free
1221	For God the Just is satisfied
1222	To look on Him and pardon me
1223	To look on Him and pardon me
1224	Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
1225	My perfect, spotless Righteousness
1226	The great unchangeable I AM
1227	The King of glory and of grace
1228	One with Himself, I cannot die
1229	My soul is purchased by His blood
1230	My life is hid with Christ on high
1231	With Christ my Savior and my God
1232	With Christ my Savior and my God
1233	The Glories of Calvary
1234	Lord, You're calling me to come
1235	And behold the wondrous cross
1236	To explore the depths of grace
1237	That came to me at such a cost
1238	Where Your boundless love
1239	Conquered my boundless sin
1240	And mercy's arms were opened wide
1241	My heart is filled with a thousand songs
1242	Proclaiming the glories of Calvary
1243	With every breath, Lord how I long
1244	To sing of Jesus who died for me
1245	Lord, take me deeper
1246	Into the glories of Calvary
1247	Sinners find eternal joy
1248	In the triumph of Your wounds
1249	By our Savior's crimson flow
1250	Holy wrath has been removed
1251	And Your saints below
1252	Join with your saints above
1253	Rejoicing in the Risen Lamb
1254	My heart is filled with a thousand songs

1257	To sing of Jesus who died for me
1258	Lord, take me deeper
1259	Into the glories of Calvary

1294	The Glory of the Cross
1295	Oh, to see the dawn
1296	Of the darkest day:
1297	Christ on the road to Calvary.
1298	Tried by sinful men,
1299	Torn and beaten, then
1300	Nailed to a cross of wood.
1301	This, the pow'r of the cross:
1302	Christ became sin for us;
1303	Took the blame, bore the wrath—
1304	We stand forgiven at the cross.
1305	Oh, to see the pain
1306	Written on Your face,
1307	Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
1308	Ev'ry bitter thought,
1309	Ev'ry evil deed
1310	Crowning Your bloodstained brow.
1311	This, the pow'r of the cross:
1312	Christ became sin for us;
1313	Took the blame, bore the wrath—
1314	We stand forgiven at the cross.
1315	Now the daylight flees;
1316	Now the ground beneath
1317	Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
1318	Curtain torn in two,
1319	Dead are raised to life;
1320	Finished! the vict'ry cry.
1321	This, the pow'r of the cross:
1322	Christ became sin for us;
1323	Took the blame, bore the wrath—
1324	We stand forgiven at the cross.
1325	Oh, to see my name
1326	Written in the wounds,
1327	For through Your suffering I am free.
1328	Death is crushed to death;
1329	Life is mine to live,
1330	Won through Your selfless love.
1331	This, the pow'r of the cross:
1332	Son of God—slain for us.
1333	What a love! What a cost!
1334	We stand forgiven at the cross.
1335	This, the pow'r of the cross:
1336	Son of God—slain for us.
1337	What a love! What a cost!
1338	We stand forgiven at the cross.

1457	I Stand In Awe
1458	You are beautiful beyond description
1459	Too marvelous for words
1460	Too wonderful for comprehension
1461	Like nothing ever seen or heard
1462	Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom?

1464	You are beautiful beyond description
1465	Majesty, enthroned above
1466	And I stand, I stand in awe of You
1467	I stand, I stand in awe of You
1468	Holy God, to whom all praise is due
1469	I stand in awe of You
1470	You are beautiful beyond description
1471	Yet God crushed You for my sin

1492	Haven’t You been good?
1493	Haven’t You been so good?
1494	Glory to Your name
1495	Glory to Your holy name

1512	How Firm a Foundation
1513	How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
1514	Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
1515	What more can He say than to you He hath said
1516	To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled
1517	Fear not, I am with thee; oh be not dismayed
1518	For I am thy God and will still give thee aid
1519	I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand
1520	Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand
1521	When through the deep waters I call thee to go
1522	The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow
1523	For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless
1524	And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress
1525	When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie
1526	My grace all sufficient shall be thy supply
1527	The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
1528	Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine
1529	The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
1530	I will not, I will not desert to its foes
1531	That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
1532	I'll never, no never, no never forsake
1533	Everlasting
1534	Oh God our Redeemer
1535	Our Savior our friend
1536	Creator of the universe
1537	Your goodness knows no end
1538	And our voices join
1539	With the thousands who
1540	Know mercy because of the Cross
1541	All sinners washed
1542	In Your precious blood
1543	Forever we will sing
1544	From everlasting to everlasting
1545	Praise be to You
1546	From everlasting to everlasting
1547	Praise be to You
1548	Oh God
1549	Oh God our Deliverer
1550	And Lord of all grace
1551	How can I stand in silence
1552	When the heavens sing Your praise
1553	And our voices join
1554	With the thousands who
1555	Know mercy because of the Cross
1556	All sinners washed
1557	In Your precious blood
1558	Forever we will sing
1559	The Gospel Song (reprise)
1560	The gospel was promised by sages and prophets
1561	The Scriptures spoke of a Son
1562	Descendant of David and yet uncreated
1563	Clothed in our flesh He would come
1564	Predestined to seek us, He took on our weakness
1565	And died our death on the cross
1566	But just as was spoken, the grave could not hold Him
1567	The glorious Son of God
1568	His name is Jesus
1569	His name is Jesus
1570	His name is Jesus Christ, our Lord
1571	We're loved and forgiven, compelled by a vision
1572	To see His mercy proclaimed
1573	Announcing salvation to every nation
1574	All for the sake of His name
1575	We're no longer strangers, for Jesus, our Savior
1576	Has come to make us His own
1577	We're called to be holy and now we live only
1578	To make His glory known
1579	His name is Jesus
1580	His name is Jesus
1581	His name is Jesus Christ, our Lord
1582	Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed
1583	Alas, and did my Savior bleed
1584	And did my Sovereign die?
1585	Would He devote that sacred head
1586	For such a worm as I?
1587	Was it for sins that I had done
1588	He groaned upon the tree?
1589	Amazing pity, grace unknown
1590	And love beyond degree
1591	My God, why would You shed Your blood
1592	So pure and undefiled
1593	To make a sinful one like me
1594	Your chosen, precious child?
1595	Well might the sun in darkness hide
1596	And shut His glories in
1597	When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
1598	For man, the creature's, sin
1599	Thus might I hide my blushing face
1600	While His dear cross appears
1601	Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
1602	And melt my eyes to tears
1603	Before the Cross
1604	My Savior's sacrifice paid for all my sin
1605	So in my suffering I look to the cross again
1606	No need, no want, no trial, no pain
1607	Can compare to this
1608	The wrath of God, once meant for me
1609	Was all spent on Him
1610	Before the Cross, I humbly bow
1611	I place my trust in the Savior
1612	Your finished work captures my gaze
1613	You bore the wrath, I know the grace
1614	In my darkest hour, Your presence is my peace
1615	In my days of joy, Your grace carries me
1616	Jesus, my Great High Priest
1617	The One who pleads for me
1618	My heart is filled with faith in You
1619	Here at Calvary on my knees
1620	Before the Cross, I humbly bow
1621	I place my trust in the Savior
1622	Your finished work captures my gaze
1623	You bore the wrath, I know the grace
1624	No need, no want, no trial, no pain
1625	Can compare to this
1626	That the wrath of God, once meant for me
1627	Was all spent on Him
1628	Before the Cross, I humbly bow
1629	I place my trust in the Savior
1630	Your finished work captures my gaze
1631	You bore the wrath, I know the grace
1632	Before the Cross, Lord, I humbly bow
1633	I place my trust in the Savior
1634	Your finished work captures my gaze
1635	You bore the wrath, I know the grace
1636	I Come by the Blood
1637	You are the perfect and righteous God
1638	Whose presence bears no sin
1639	You bid me come to Your holy place
1640	How can I enter in
1641	When Your presence bears no sin?
1642	Through Him, who poured out His life for me
1643	The atoning Lamb of God
1644	Through Him, and His work alone
1645	I boldly come
1646	I come by the blood, I come by the cross
1647	Where Your mercy flows
1648	From hands pierced for me
1649	For I dare not stand on my righteousness
1650	My every hope rests on what Christ has done
1651	And I come by the blood
1652	You are the high and exalted King
1653	The One the angels fear
1654	So far above me in every way
1655	Lord, how can I draw near
1656	To the One the angels fear?
1657	Through Him who laid down His life for me
1658	And ascended to Your side
1659	Through Him, through Jesus alone
1660	I boldly come
1661	Only in the Cross
1662	When I look upon the cross
1663	In that spectacle of suffering
1664	I see the power of God
1665	There the Son of God was crushed
1666	And lifted up to die for me
1667	And conquered death forever
1668	So I will glory only in the cross
1669	Yes, I will glory only in the cross
1670	And I will make my boast
1671	In the Lord Jesus Christ
1672	Crucified to ransom us
1673	When I look upon the cross
1674	In what might seem a senseless death
1675	I see the wisdom of God
1676	For there the sinless Holy One
1677	Was made to be sin for me
1678	Then He declared me righteous
1679	So I will glory only in the cross
1680	Yes, I will glory only in the cross
1681	And I will make my boast
1682	In the Lord Jesus Christ
1683	Crucified to ransom us
1684	This Fathomless Love
1685	Lord, what moved Your heart to love lowly man
1686	before any star could herald Your praise?
1687	And why did You come, abasing Yourself,
1688	veiled in a robe of frail human clay?
1689	Why would You the pure give Your life fore the vile,
1690	the innocent seeking the guilty to be reconciled?
1691	I can't comprehend this fathomless love.
1692	I'm gripped and amazed at what You have done.
1693	Why would the adored become the despised
1694	to bear all the furious wrath that was mine?
1695	How awesome this mystery
1696	of Your fathomless love for me.
1697	Why would You adopt and take as Your own
1698	those who had crushed Your one precious Son?
1699	Why mercy and grace towards Your enemies?
1700	Your name they have cursed and Your throne they have shunned.
1701	Oh how could You choose to show kindness to these?
1702	The ones who would mock You and hate You,
1703	the ones just like me?
1704	Mercies Anew
1705	Every morning that breaks
1706	There are mercies anew
1707	Every breath that I take
1708	Is your faithfulness proved
1709	And at the end of each day
1710	When my labors are through
1711	I will sing of Your mercies anew
1712	When I've fallen and strayed
1713	There were mercies anew
1714	For you sought me in love
1715	And my heart you pursued
1716	In the face of my sin
1717	Lord, You never withdrew
1718	So I sing of Your mercies anew
1719	And Your mercies, they will never end
1720	For ten thousand years they'll remain
1721	And when this world's beauty has passed away
1722	Your mercies will be unchanged
1723	And when the storms swirl and rage
1724	There are mercies anew
1725	In affliction and pain
1726	You will carry me through
1727	And at the end of my days
1728	When Your throne fills my view
1729	I will sing of Your mercies anew
1730	I will sing of Your mercies anew
1731	Oh the Deep, Deep Love
1732	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
1733	Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free
1734	Rolling as a mighty ocean
1735	In its fullness over me
1736	Underneath me, all around me
1737	Is the current of Your love
1738	Leading onward, leading homeward
1739	To Your glorious rest above
1740	Oh the deep, deep love
1741	All I need and trust
1742	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
1743	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
1744	Spread His praise from shore to shore
1745	How He came to pay our ransom
1746	Through the saving cross He bore
1747	How He watches o'er His loved ones
1748	Those He died to make His own
1749	How for them He's interceding
1750	Pleading now before the throne
1751	Oh the deep, deep love
1752	All I need and trust
1753	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
1754	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
1755	Far surpassing all the rest
1756	It's an ocean full of blessing
1757	In the midst of every test
1758	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
1759	Mighty Savior, precious Friend
1760	You will bring us home to glory
1761	Where Your love will never end
1762	Oh the deep, deep love
1763	All I need and trust
1764	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
1765	Oh the deep, deep love
1766	All I need and trust
1767	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
1768	Oh the deep, deep love
1769	All I need and trust
1770	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
1771	Oh the deep, deep love
1772	All I need and trust
1773	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus!
1774	Oh the deep, deep love
1775	All I need and trust
1776	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
1777	The Power of the Cross (Live)
1778	Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
1779	Christ on the road to Calvary
1780	Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
1781	Nailed to a cross of wood
1782	This, the power of the cross
1783	Christ became sin for us
1784	Took the blame, bore the wrath
1785	We stand forgiven at the cross
1786	Oh, to see the pain written on Your face
1787	Bearing the awesome weight of sin
1788	Ev'ry bitter thought, ev'ry evil deed
1789	Crowning Your bloodstained brow
1790	Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
1791	Quakes as its Maker bows His head
1792	Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
1793	Finished the vict'ry cry
1794	Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
1795	For through Your suffering I am free
1796	Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
1797	Won through Your selfless love
1798	This, the power of the cross
1799	Son of God, slain for us
1800	What a love, what a cost
1801	We stand forgiven at the cross
1802	We Will Glorify
1803	We will glorify the Lamb
1804	We will glorify the Lord of lords
1805	Who is the great I am
1806	Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty
1807	We will bow before His throne
1808	We will worship Him in righteousness
1809	We will worship Him alone
1810	We will glorify the King of kings
1811	We will glorify the Lamb
1812	We will glorify the Lord of lords
1813	Who is the great I am
1814	He is Lord of Heaven, Lord of Earth
1815	He is Lord of all who live
1816	He is Lord above the universe
1817	All praise to Him we give
1818	Oh, hallelujah to the King of kings
1819	Hallelujah to the Lamb
1820	Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords
1821	Who is the great I am
1822	We will glorify the King of kings
1823	We will glorify the Lamb
1824	We will glorify the Lord of lords
1825	Who is the great I am
1826	Who is the great I am
1827	When Trials Come
1828	When trials come no longer fear
1829	For in the pain our God draws near
1830	To fire a faith worth more than gold
1831	And there His faithfulness is told
1832	And there His faithfulness is told
1833	Within the night I know Your peace
1834	The breath of God brings strength to me
1835	And new each morning mercy flows
1836	As treasures of the darkness grow
1837	As treasures of the darkness grow
1838	I turn to Wisdom not my own
1839	For every battle You have known
1840	My confidence will rest in You
1841	Your love endures Your ways are good
1842	Your love endures Your ways are good
1843	When I am weary with the cost
1844	I see the triumph of the cross
1845	So in it's shadow I shall run
1846	Till He completes the work begun
1847	Till He completes the work begun
1848	One day all things will be made new
1849	I'll see the hope You called me to
1850	And in your kingdom paved with gold
1851	I'll praise your faithfulness of old
1852	I'll praise your faithfulness of old
1853	I'll praise your faithfulness of old
1854	I'll praise your faithfulness of old
1855	I Asked the Lord That I Might Grow
1856	I asked the Lord that I might grow
1857	In faith and love, and ev'ry grace,
1858	Might more of His salvation know,
1859	And seek more earnestly His face.
1860	'Twas He who taught me thus to pray,
1861	And He, I trust, has answered prayer,
1862	But it has been in such a way
1863	As almost drove me to despair.
1864	I hoped that in some favoured hour
1865	At once He'd answer my request
1866	And, by His love's constraining pow'r,
1867	Subdue my sins, and give me rest.
1868	Instead of this, He made me feel
1869	The hidden evils of my heart
1870	And let the angry pow'rs of hell
1871	Assault my soul, in ev'ry part.
1872	Yea, more with His own hand He seemed
1873	Intent to aggravate my woe,
1874	Crossed all the fair designs I schemed,
1875	Humbled my heart, and laid me low.
1876	Lord, why is this, I trembling cried;
1877	Wilt Thou pursue Thy worm to death?
1878	Tis in this way, the Lord replied,
1879	I answer prayer for grace and faith.
1880	"These inward trials I employ
From self and pride to set thee free
And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me."
1881	"And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me."
1882	When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
1883	When I survey the wondrous cross
1884	On which the Prince of glory died,
1885	My richest gain I count but loss,
1886	And pour contempt on all my pride.
1887	Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
1888	Save in the death of Christ, my God.
1889	All the vain things that charm me most,
1890	I sacrifice them to His blood.
1891	See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
1892	Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
1893	Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
1894	Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
1895	Were the whole realm of nature mine,
1896	That were a present far too small.
1897	Love so amazing, so divine,
1898	Demands my soul, my life, my all.
1899	Jesus Paid It All
1900	I hear the Savior say,
1901	"Thy strength indeed is small.
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."
1902	Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
1903	Sin had left a crimson stain,
1904	He washed it white as snow.
1905	Lord, now indeed I find
1906	Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
1907	Can change the leper's spots
1908	And melt the heart of stone.
1909	Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
1910	Sin had left a crimson stain,
1911	He washed it white as snow.
1912	For nothing good have I
1913	Whereby Thy grace to claim;
1914	I'll wash my garments white
1915	In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.
1916	Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
1917	Sin had left a crimson stain,
1918	He washed it white as snow.
1919	And when, before the throne,
1920	I stand in Him complete,
1921	Jesus died my soul to save,
1922	My lips shall still repeat.
1923	Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
1924	Sin had left a crimson stain,
1925	He washed it white as snow.
1926	Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
1927	Sin had left a crimson stain,
1928	He washed it white as snow.
1929	I Hear the Words of Love
1930	I hear the words of love,
1931	I gaze upon the blood,
1932	I see the mighty sacrifice,
1933	And I have peace with God.
1934	‘Tis everlasting peace!
1935	Sure as Jehovah's Name;
1936	‘Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
1937	Forevermore the same.
1938	The clouds may come and go
1939	And storms may sweep my sky;
1940	This blood-sealed friendship changes not;
1941	The cross is ever nigh.
1942	My love is oft-times low,
1943	My joy still ebbs and flows;
1944	But peace with Him remains the same;
1945	No change Jehovah knows.
1946	I change, He changes not,
1947	The Christ can never die;
1948	His love, not mine, the resting place,
1949	His truth, not mine, the tie.
1950	Holy, Holy, Holy
1951	Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
1952	Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
1953	Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
1954	God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
1955	Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,
1956	Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea,
1957	Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
1958	Who wert and art, and evermore shalt be.
1959	Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,
1960	Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;
1961	Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
1962	Perfect in power, love, and purity.
1963	Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
1964	All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea;
1965	Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
1966	God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
1967	Speak, O Lord
1968	Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
1969	To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
1970	Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
1971	Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
1972	That the light of Christ might be seen today
1973	In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
1974	Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
1975	All Your purposes for Your glory.
1976	Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
1977	Holy reverence, true humility;
1978	Test our thoughts and our attitudes
1979	In the radiance of Your purity.
1980	Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
1981	Your majestic love and authority.
1982	Words of pow'r that can never fail—
1983	Let their truth prevail over unbelief.
1984	Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
1985	Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us—
1986	Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
1987	That will echo down through eternity.
1988	And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
1989	And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
1990	Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
1991	And the earth is filled with Your glory.
1992	I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeemer Art
1993	I greet Thee, who my sure Redeemer art,
1994	My only Trust and Savior of my heart,
1995	Who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;
1996	I pray Thee, from our hearts all cares to take.
1997	Thou art the King of mercy and of grace,
1998	Reigning omnipotent in every place;
1999	So come, O King, and our whole being sway;
2000	Shine on us with the light of Thy pure day.
2001	Thou art the life by which alone we live
2002	And all our substance and our strength receive;
2003	Sustain us by Thy faith and by Thy pow'r,
2004	And give us strength in ev'ry trying hour.
2005	Our hope is in no other save in Thee;
2006	Our faith is built upon Thy promise free;
2007	Lord, give us peace and make us calm and sure,
2008	That in Thy strength we evermore endure.
2009	Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me
2010	Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
2011	Let me hide myself in Thee;
2012	Let the water and the blood,
2013	From Thy wounded side which flowed,
2014	Be of sin the double cure;
2015	Save from wrath and make me pure.
2016	While I draw this fleeting breath,
2017	When mine eyes shall close in death,
2018	When I soar to worlds unknown,
2019	See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
2020	Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
2021	Let me hide myself in Thee.
2022	In Christ Alone (Live)
2023	In Christ alone my hope is found,
2024	He is my light, my strength, my song;
2025	This Cornerstone, this solid Ground
2026	Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
2027	What heights of love, what depths of peace,
2028	When fears are stilled, when striving cease!
2029	My Comforter, my All in All,
2030	Here in the love of Christ I stand.
2031	In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
2032	Fullness of God in helpless babe.
2033	This gift of love and righteousness,
2034	Scorned by the ones He came to save;
2035	Till on that cross as Jesus die,
2036	The wrath of God was satisfied.
2037	For every sin on Him was laid;
2038	Here in the death of Christ I live.
2039	There in the ground His body lay,
2040	Light of the world by darkness slain;
2041	Then bursting forth in glorious day
2042	Up from the grave He rose again!
2043	And as He stands in victory,
2044	Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
2045	For I am HIs and He is mine,
2046	Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
2047	No guilt in life, no fear in death,
2048	This is the power of Christ in me;
2049	From life's first cry to final breath,
2050	Jesus commands my destiny.
2051	No power of hell, no scheme of man,
2052	Can ever pluck me from His hand;
2053	Till He returns or calls me home,
2054	Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
2055	Joy to the World (Our God Reigns)
2056	There is a light
2057	It burns brighter than the sun
2058	He steals the night
2059	And casts no shadow

2062	He never fails. So take heart

2169	The Gospel Song
2170	Holy God in love became
2171	Perfect man to bear my blame
2172	On the cross he took my sin
2173	By his death I live again
2174	Holy God in love became
2175	Perfect man to bear my blame
2176	On the cross he took my sin
2177	By his death I live again
2178	All I Have Is Christ (Live)
2179	I once was lost in darkest night
2180	Yet thought I knew the way
2181	The sin that promised joy and life
2182	Had led me to the grave
2183	I had no hope that You would own
2184	A rebel to Your will
2185	And if You had not loved me first
2186	I would refuse You still
2187	But as I ran my hell-bound race
2188	Indifferent to the cost
2189	You looked upon my helpless state
2190	And led me to the cross
2191	And I beheld God's love displayed
2192	You suffered in my place
2193	You bore the wrath reserved for me
2194	Now all I know is grace
2195	Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
2196	Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
2197	Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
2198	Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
2199	Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
2200	And live so all might see
2201	The strength to follow Your commands
2202	Could never come from me
2203	Oh Father, use my ransomed life
2204	In any way You choose
2205	And let my song forever be

2218	By His Son God now has spoken
2219	‘Tis the true and faithful Word
2220	Tell me, ye who hear Him groaning
2221	Was there ever grief like His?
2222	Friends through fear His cause disowning
2223	Foes insulting His distress
2224	Many hands were raised to wound Him
2225	None would interpose to save
2226	But the deepest stroke that pierced Him
2227	Was the stroke that Justice gave
2228	Ye who think of sin but lightly
2229	Nor suppose the evil great
2230	Here may view its nature rightly
2231	Here its guilt may estimate
2232	Mark the sacrifice appointed

2249	My name is written on His hands
2250	Five bleeding wounds He bears, received on Calvary

2858	His name is Jesus Christ, our Lord
2859	Because You First Loved Me
2860	Love is patient, love is kind
2861	Everywhere and every time
2862	It gives its place in line
2863	To serve another
2864	But my heart it struggles so
2865	I need Your grace to grow
2866	Lord, help me give and show
2867	This love to others
2868	Jesus, set me free to love unselfishly
2869	Because You first loved me
2870	I can love You
2871	With all my heart
2872	Because You first loved me
2873	I'll love others too
2874	The way You do
2875	I'll love them too
2876	When I love, it looks like this:
2877	It always gives and gives
2878	To God and then it lives
2879	To help my neighbor
2880	That's a love I haven't got
2881	It's me I love a lot
2882	Stuck here I'm tied in knots
2883	I need a Savior
2884	Jesus, set me free to love
2885	You more than me
2886	Because You first loved me
2887	I can love You
2888	With all my heart
2889	Because You first loved me
2890	I'll love others too
2891	The way You do
2892	I'll love them too
2893	Because You first loved me
2894	I can love You
2895	With all my heart
2896	Because You first loved me
2897	I'll love others too
2898	The way You do
2899	I'll love them too
2900	To Be Like Jesus
2901	Love, joy, peace, and patience too
2902	Grow in those who trust in You
2903	All who put their hope in Christ
2904	Kindness, goodness, faithfulness
2905	Self-control and gentleness
2906	Live in those who have new life
2907	I want to be like Jesus
2908	To walk and talk like Jesus
2909	I want to live like one who follows Him
2910	I want to love like Jesus
2911	To give my all like Jesus
2912	I want to live like one who follows Him
2913	I don't always do what's right
2914	Jesus lived a perfect life
2915	And for sins like mine He died
2916	Teach me to obey Your Word
2917	Help me to put others first
2918	Holy Spirit, change my life
2919	Make Me Wise
2920	Shades from the past are chasing my life
2921	The world we built together is crumbling down
2922	I'm so sick of being the sailor
2923	When the ship we are sailing is sinking down
2924	You, you blamed me all the time, asking for more
2925	But what I got back? Nothing! Nothing!
2926	And all the fears I had are getting so real
2927	And all the secrets you kept are falling to pieces
2928	Do you remember when we used to shine like diamonds?
2929	When everything around us was just a fucking fairy tale
2930	That time has gone so far away and I'm still dying in my memories
2931	While you just left me with a spit on my face
2932	Every teardrop has become blood
2933	You fucking cunt get on your dirty disgusting
2934	Knees
2935	And I won't be ashamed
2936	To watch myself in the mirror
2937	Cause I will never live my life behind a mask
2938	Time is running out
2939	I'm taking back my life
2940	Cause I wanna come back to shine
2941	I won't forget your promise
2942	You were supposed to save me
2943	And I've been trying to bear all that you did
2944	What you believed in
2945	I won't regret my choices
2946	I was supposed to grow old with you
2947	But you denied my life and what I did
2948	What I believed in
2949	I've no remorses
2950	You've just regrets
2951	They're gonna chase you
2952	Until you'll dig your own grave
2953	I sewed my fucking eyes
2954	The darkness shows me all the secrets you hide
2955	Now just look yourself in the mirror
2956	The ghost you keep inside will never die
2957	Time is running out
2958	I'm taking back my life
2959	Cause I wanna come back to shine
2960	I won't forget your promise
2961	You were supposed to save me
2962	And I've been trying to bear all that you did
2963	What you believed in
2964	I won't regret my choices
2965	I was supposed to grow old with you
2966	But you denied my life and what I did
2967	What I believed in
2968	Trust In the Lord
2969	"My father said, ""Don't forget my teaching"
2970	But hold on tight to my commands
2971	For long life and peace they will add to you
2972	Don't let love and kindness leave you
2973	Write them down upon your heart
2974	"And God and people will smile on you"""
2975	Trust in the Lord with all your heart
2976	And do not lean on your own understanding
2977	In all your ways acknowledge Him
2978	And He'll make straight all your paths
2979	Trust in the Lord
2980	"My father said, ""Don't be wise in your eyes"
2981	But fear the Lord and turn from sin
2982	"And God will heal you and give you strength"""
2983	Look to Jesus to be your treasure
2984	He's worth more than jewels and gold
2985	For He's more precious than anything
2986	Jesus, You're my confidence, Jesus, You're my hope
2987	You will keep my feet from stumbling
2988	Jesus, You're my confidence, Jesus, You're my hope
2989	You will keep my feet from stumbling
2990	I'll trust in the Lord with all my heart
2991	And will not lean on my own understanding
2992	In all my ways I'll acknowledge Him
2993	And He'll make straight all my paths
2994	Trust in the Lord
2995	It Is Not Death to Die
2996	It is not death to die
2997	To leave this weary road
2998	And join the saints who dwell on high
2999	Who've found their home with God
3000	It is not death to close
3001	The eyes long dimmed by tears
3002	And wake in joy before Your throne
3003	Delivered from our fears
3004	O Jesus, conquering the grave
3005	Your precious blood has power to save
3006	Those who trust in You
3007	Will in Your mercy find
3008	That it is not death to die
3009	It is not death to fling
3010	Aside this earthly dust
3011	And rise with strong and noble wing
3012	To live among the just
3013	It is not death to hear
3014	The key unlock the door
3015	That sets us free from mortal years
3016	To praise You evermore
3017	O Jesus, conquering the grave
3018	Your precious blood has power to save
3019	Those who trust in You
3020	Will in Your mercy find
3021	That it is not death to die
3022	I Have a Shelter
3023	We do not have the lyrics for I Have a Shelter yet.
3024	Glorious
3025	How great You are
3026	Your greatness none can fathom
3027	Upholding all
3028	By Your almighty Word
3029	The universe
3030	Fulfills Your every purpose
3031	And all You've made
3032	Will bring You praise, O God
3033	You are glorious, glorious
3034	And we will lift our voices to worship You
3035	You are glorious, glorious
3036	And we will always be in awe of You
3037	You move the stars
3038	The planets in their courses
3039	The clouds and wind
3040	And everything that moves
3041	You hold my life
3042	You take my joys and sorrows
3043	And cause them all
3044	To bring glory to You
3045	Your ways are high
3046	Too deep for man to fathom
3047	But You are good
3048	And this will be my theme
3049	You sent Your Son
3050	To live and die for sinners
3051	So I will trust
3052	And hope in You, my King
3053	Joy in My Morning
3054	When darkness falls
3055	Temptations call
3056	And all around me seems undone
3057	You hear my pleas
3058	Supply my needs
3059	And tell me of Your wondrous love
3060	You are the joy in my morning
3061	You're my song of praise
3062	Just like the new day dawning
3063	Flooding my world with grace
3064	Though trials come
3065	And every one
3066	Can take me further from Your truth
3067	You calm my fears
3068	Dry all my tears
3069	And draw me closer, Lord, to You
3070	In You there's no shadow of turning
3071	Constant in all Your ways
3072	You're growing my faith
3073	And I'm learning to lean
3074	On You all of my days
3075	Our Hope Is Alive
3076	Hope that is seen is no hope at all
3077	Our hope is in what is to come
3078	Christ coming again to bring us to heav'n
3079	A glorious end to our fall
3080	The trials we face will fade
3081	When all our tears are washed away
3082	Rejoice!
3083	Our hope is alive
3084	Alive in Him, the Son is risen
3085	Rejoice!
3086	One day we'll arise
3087	From death to life, our hope is alive in Christ
3088	Hope isn't found in things we possess
3089	Nor found in the praises of men
3090	Our will to survive won't bring us new life
3091	We look past this world to the next
3092	Coming on the clouds
3093	We'll see the King and all will bow
3094	Rejoice! Our hope is alive in Christ
3095	Rejoice! Our hope is alive in Christ
3096	Rejoice! Our hope is alive
3097	Rejoice! Our hope is alive
3098	Rejoice! Our hope is alive in Christ

3100	Glory Awaits
3101	Blood-bought children who are suff'ring
3102	It won't be long, It won't be long
3103	Storm-tossed pilgrim, if you're struggling
3104	It won't be long, It won't be long
3105	Though your flesh is now decaying
3106	It won't be long, It won't be long
3107	A new body God is making
3108	It won't be long, It won't be long
3109	Glory awaits
3110	For all God's redeemed
3111	Glory awaits
3112	And we'll be free
3113	All you saints now bound in prison
3114	It won't be long, It won't be long
3115	Here's your freedom: Christ is risen

3127	Glory awaits
3128	And we'll be free
3129	Nothing in All the Earth
3130	What shall separate us from Your love?
3131	Can years of sorrow break eternal bonds?
3132	Can condemnation ever raise its voice
3133	Against the pardon of the blood of Christ?
3134	Though our journey here is long
3135	This will be our triumph song
3136	Nothing in all the earth
3137	Not any height above
3138	Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
3139	Nothing in all the earth
3140	Not any height above
3141	Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
3142	What shall separate us from Your love?
3143	For now the sting of death is overcome
3144	And all the powers of this world must fall
3145	Before Your feet because You rule them all
3146	And though our journey here is long
3147	This shall be our triumph song
3148	Nothing in all the earth
3149	Not any height above
3150	Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
3151	Nothing in all the earth
3152	Not any height above
3153	Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
3154	Nothing in all the earth
3155	Could ever tear us from

3157	O Holy Night (Hear the Gospel Story)
3158	O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,
3159	It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.
3160	Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
3161	Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
3162	A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
3163	For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
3164	Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
3165	O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
3166	Humbly He lay, Creator come as creature,
3167	Born on the floor of a hay-scattered stall.
3168	True Son of God, yet bearing human feature,
3169	He entered earth to reverse Adam's fall.
3170	In towering grace, He laid aside His glory,
3171	And in our place, was sacrificed for sin.
3172	Fall on your knees! O hear the gospel story!
3173	O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
3174	Come then to Him Who lies within the manger,
3175	With joyful shepherds, proclaim Him as Lord.
3176	Let not the Promised Son remain a stranger;
3177	In reverent worship, make Christ your Adored.
3178	Eternal life is theirs who would receive Him;
3179	With grace and peace, their lives He will adorn.
3180	Fall on your knees! Receive the Gift of heaven!
3181	O night divine, O night when Christ was born
3182	O night, O holy night when Christ was born
3183	Who Would Have Dreamed
3184	On a starlit hillside, shepherds watched their sheep
3185	Slowly, David's city drifted off to sleep
3186	But to this little town of no great renown
3187	The Lord had a promise to keep
3188	Prophets had foretold it, a mighty King would come
3189	Long-awaited Ruler, God's anointed one
3190	But the Sovereign of all looked helpless and small
3191	As God gave the world His own Son
3192	And who would have dreamed or ever foreseen
3193	That we could hold God in our hands?
3194	The Giver of Life is born in the night
3195	Revealing God's glorious plan
3196	To save the world
3197	Wondrous gift of heaven: the Father sends the Son
3198	Planned from time eternal, moved by holy love
3199	He will carry our curse and death He'll reverse
3200	So we can be daughters and sons
3201	Before the Skies
3202	Before the skies were stretched abroad
3203	From everlasting was the Word
3204	God was He; the Word was God
3205	And He must be adored
3206	By the Word all came to be
3207	The universe and all contained
3208	Showing God's authority
3209	His power and His reign
3210	Glory, glory
3211	Glory in the highest
3212	Glory, glory
3213	Glory God is with us
3214	With us
3215	Though His glories still proceed
3216	Never changing from our Lord
3217	He laid down His majesty
3218	And took on human form
3219	Mortals here beheld His face
3220	The Heav'nly Father's perfect Son
3221	Full of truth and full of grace
3222	The Savior now has come!
3223	He gave up His life in love
3224	So our lips could gladly tell
3225	Christ, the Word, has come to us
3226	Our Lord, Immanuel
3227	One Still Night
3228	One still night, Mary awoke
3229	Stirred by an angel, she trembled as he spoke
3230	One small child would soon be born
3231	The King of kings will wear a crown of thorns
3232	Glory to God, the angels sang
3233	"Immanuel was born for you this day
Peace on earth, good will toward men
Immanuel has come to Bethlehem
Immanuel has come to Bethlehem"
3234	One still night, while Joseph dreamed
3235	He saw a vision within his troubled sleep
3236	One small child, his bride would give
3237	Deliverer delivered to save us from our sin
3238	And to His kingdom there'll be no end
3239	And to His kingdom there'll be no end
3240	And to His kingdom there'll be no end
3241	One still night, a light was shown
3242	That all the darkness could never overcome
3243	O Come, O Come, Emmanuel
3244	O come, O come, Emmanuel
3245	And ransom captive Israel
3246	That mourns in lonely exile here
3247	Until the Son of God appear
3248	O come, Thou, Dayspring from on high
3249	And cause Thy light on us to rise
3250	Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
3251	And death's dark shadow put to flight
3252	Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
3253	Shall come to thee, O Israel
3254	O come, O come, true prophet of the Lord
3255	And turn the key to heaven's door
3256	Be Thou our comforter and guide
3257	And lead us to the Father's side
3258	Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
3259	Shall by His word our darkness dispel
3260	O come, our great High Priest, and intercede
3261	Thy sacrifice, our only plea
3262	The judgment we no longer fear
3263	Thy precious blood has brought us near
3264	Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
3265	Has banished every fear of hell
3266	O Come, Thou King of nations bring
3267	An end to all our suffering
3268	Bid every pain and sorrow cease
3269	And reign now as our Prince of Peace
3270	Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
3271	Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
3272	Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
3273	Shall come again with us to dwell
3274	God Made Low
3275	Prophets promised long ago
3276	A King would come to bring us hope
3277	And now a virgin bears a son
3278	The time to save the world has come
3279	Humble shepherds run in haste
3280	To see the One the angels praised
3281	In cattle stall they find a girl
3282	Who holds the hope of all the world
3283	Emmanuel has come to us
3284	The Christ is born, Hallelujah!
3285	Our God made low to raise us up
3286	Emmanuel, has come to us
3287	As He sleeps upon the hay
3288	He holds the moon and stars in place
3289	Though born an infant He remains
3290	The sovereign God of endless days
3291	For all our sins one day He'll die
3292	To make us sons of God on high
3293	Let every heart prepare Him room
3294	The promises have all come true
3295	What Child Is This
3296	What Child is this Who, laid to rest
3297	On Mary's lap is sleeping?
3298	Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
3299	While shepherds watch are keeping?
3300	This, this is Christ the King
3301	Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
3302	Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
3303	The Babe, the Son of Mary
3304	Why lies He in such mean estate
3305	Where ox and lamb are feeding?
3306	Good Christian, fear, for sinners here
3307	The silent Word is pleading
3308	Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
3309	The cross be borne for me, for you
3310	Hail, hail the Word made flesh
3311	The Babe, the Son of Mary
3312	So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
3313	Come peasant, king to own Him
3314	The King of kings salvation brings
3315	Let loving hearts enthrone Him
3316	Raise, raise a song on high
3317	The virgin sings her lullaby
3318	Joy, joy for Christ is born
3319	The Babe, the Son of Mary
3320	He Who Is Mighty
3321	Oh, the mercy our God has shown
3322	To those who sit in death's shadow
3323	The sun on high pierced the night
3324	Born was the Cornerstone
3325	Unto us a Son is given, unto us a Child is born
3326	He Who is mighty has done a great thing
3327	Taken on flesh, conquered death's sting
3328	Shattered the darkness and lifted our shame
3329	Holy is His name
3330	Oh, the freedom our Savior won
3331	The yoke of sin has been broken
3332	Once a slave, now by grace
3333	No more condemnation

3459	It's Your Grace
3460	You will save whom You will save
3461	We're the lost and helpless ones
3462	The rebels and the renegades
3463	Who spurned Your holy love
3464	You will save whom You will save
3465	Mercy will be magnified
3466	Everyone has gone astray
3467	And followed after lies
3468	But You have loved us and opened our eyes
3469	It's Your grace
3470	From beginning to the end
3471	It's Your grace
3472	We will never comprehend
3473	Why You drew the ones who ran from You
3474	What can we do but offer You praise?
3475	You will save whom You will save
3476	We were captive to our wills
3477	And if our hearts had not been changed
3478	We'd flee Your mercy still
3479	You will save whom You will save
3480	Who can question what You do?
3481	You're the potter, we're the clay
3482	You can make us as You choose
3483	And there is no one who boasts before You
3484	You will save whom You will save
3485	Yet the promised hope remains
3486	You will rescue anyone
3487	Who calls upon Your name
3488	You will save whom You will save
3489	Faithful love won't be denied
3490	Christ has overcome the grave
3491	And for our sins He died
3492	And when He comes back His glory will shine
3493	All Glory Be Forever
3494	We had turned from God to sin's disgrace
3495	We chose the path to hell
3496	Perfect law of God condemned our race
3497	For all in Adam fell
3498	But the righteousness of God appeared
3499	And the world found hope again
3500	For the Righteous One has come down to bear
3501	All the curse of sin and death
3502	Now to Him Who's seated on the throne
3503	All glory be forever
3504	Oh, the depths of wisdom, grace, and power
3505	All glory be forever
3506	All glory be forever
3507	Every bond of sin that held us fast
3508	Is left in Jesus' grave
3509	We've been freed from all that gripped our past
3510	From Satan's rule and reign
3511	We've been raised to life to breathe again
3512	As captives now reclaimed
3513	All our guilt is gone, all our striving ceased
3514	We're alive to seek His fame
3515	Now to Him Who's seated on the throne
3516	All glory be forever
3517	Oh, the depths of wisdom, grace, and power
3518	All glory be forever
3519	All glory be forever
3520	Now our future's fixed, our journey clear
3521	God will not let us go
3522	Every trial that tempts our hearts to fear
3523	He'll use to give us hope
3524	All creation groans as we await
3525	What our eyes have longed to see
3526	Every pain and evil we've long endured
3527	Will be crushed by Christ our King
3528	Now to Him Who's seated on the throne

3531	All glory be forever
3532	All glory be forever
3533	Through the Precious Blood
3534	You have ordained every breath we take
3535	In pleasure or pain, there is no mistake
3536	Gladness and grief, both are in Your hand
3537	And sufferings brief carry out Your plan
3538	And our fleeting sorrows
3539	Will yield an endless prize
3540	When some bright tomorrow
3541	We'll see You with our eyes, and

3565	Totally God, Totally Man
3566	Jesus, He's fully God and fully man
3567	That's really hard to understand
3568	So, let me try to explain
3569	Jesus, His Word upholds the galaxies
3570	But He babbled like a baby
3571	In His mother's arms
3572	Jesus understands the universe
3573	But He had to go to school to learn
3574	How to write His name
3575	Jesus walked upon the ocean blue
3576	But His feet got tired and dirty too
3577	On the dusty roads
3578	Jesus cried when His friend Lazarus died
3579	But His power brought Him back to life
3580	When He called his name
3581	He's totally God (totally God) and totally man (totally man)
3582	Both in One (both in One), He's the great I AM (the great I AM)
3583	To save the world (to save the world), fulfill God's plan (fulfill God's plan)
3584	He had to be totally God, totally man
3585	Jesus obeyed His Father perfectly
3586	And we know that's something you and me
3587	Couldn't ever do
3588	No, no, no
3589	Jesus died to pay for all our sins
3590	Rose to save the ones who trust in Him
3591	For eternity
3592	He's totally God (totally God) and totally man (totally man)
3593	Both in One (both in One), He's the great I AM (the great I AM)
3594	To save the world (to save the world), fulfill God's plan (fulfill God's plan)

3710	Condemn me for that debt of sin
3711	Now canceled at the cross?
3712	Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
3713	Jesus, You've rescued us
3714	Through Your great love
3715	Complete atonement You have made
3716	And by Your death have fully paid
3717	The debt Your people owed
3718	No wrath remains for us to face
3719	We're sheltered by Your saving grace
3720	And sprinkled with Your blood
3721	How sweet the sound of saving grace
3722	How sweet the sound of saving grace
3723	Christ died for me
3724	Be still my soul and know this peace
3725	The merits of your great high priest
3726	Have bought your liberty

3757	All I Have Is Christ
3758	I once was lost in darkest night
3759	Yet thought I knew the way
3760	The sin that promised joy and life
3761	Had led me to the grave
3762	I had no hope that You would own
3763	A rebel to Your will
3764	And if You had not loved me first
3765	I would refuse You still
3766	But as I ran my hell-bound race
3767	Indifferent to the cost
3768	You looked upon my helpless state
3769	And led me to the cross
3770	And I beheld God's love displayed
3771	You suffered in my place
3772	You bore the wrath reserved for me
3773	Now all I know is grace
3774	Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
3775	Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
3776	Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
3777	And live so all might see
3778	The strength to follow Your commands
3779	Could never come from me
3780	Oh Father, use my ransomed life
3781	In any way You choose
3782	And let my song forever be
3783	My only boast is You
3784	Come Praise and Glorify
3785	Come praise and glorify our God
3786	The Father of our Lord
3787	In Christ He has in heav'nly realms
3788	His blessings on us poured
3789	For pure and blameless in His sight
3790	He destined us to be
3791	And now we've been adopted through
3792	His Son eternally
3793	To the praise of Your glory
3794	To the praise of Your mercy and grace
3795	To the praise of Your glory
3796	You are the God who saves
3797	Come praise and glorify our God
3798	Who gives His grace in Christ
3799	In Him our sins are washed away
3800	Redeemed through sacrifice
3801	In Him God has made known to us
3802	The myst'ry of His will
3803	That Christ should be the head of all
3804	His purpose to fulfill
3805	To the praise of Your glory
3806	To the praise of Your mercy and grace
3807	To the praise of Your glory
3808	You are the God who saves

3810	For we've believed the Word
3811	And through our faith we have a seal
3812	The Spirit of the Lord
3813	The Spirit guarantees our hope
3814	Until redemption's done
3815	Until we join in endless praise
3816	To God, the Three in One
3817	To the praise of Your glory
3818	To the praise of Your mercy and grace
3819	To the praise of Your glory
3820	You are the God who saves
3821	To the praise of Your glory
3822	To the praise of Your mercy and grace
3823	To the praise of Your glory
3824	You are the God who saves
3825	Hallowed Be Your Name
3826	Who is like You, Father
3827	The Source of life and love?
3828	An overflowing fountain
3829	In Spirit and the Son
3830	Abba! Our Father
3831	Hallowed be Your name
3832	Reigning high in heaven
3833	Receive our grateful praise
3834	Who is like You, Jesus
3835	The Son most glorious?
3836	The fullness of the Godhead
3837	Who came in flesh for us
3838	Savior, Lord Jesus
3839	Hallowed be Your name
3840	Risen now in power
3841	The Lamb for sinners slain
3842	Who is like You, Spirit
3843	Our Comfort from above?
3844	You draw us to the Savior
3845	Reveal the Father’s love
3846	Spirit, O Spirit
3847	Hallowed be Your name
3848	Fount of living water
3849	Come, fill our hearts again
3850	God, there’s no one like You
3851	For who can bear the sight?
3852	Clothed in glorious splendor
3853	In holy, burning light
3854	O God, our God
3855	Who was and is to come
3856	Father, Son, and Spirit
3857	Most holy Three-in-One
3858	We Are Not Ashamed
3859	We, we are not ashamed
3860	For the gospel is the power of God to save
3861	Yes, we, we are not ashamed
3862	For we have no other Savior to proclaim
3863	Christ alone, the Life, the Truth, the Way
3864	The news of Jesus Christ, the crucified
3865	Risen, reigning at the Father’s side
3866	Is foolishness to those who cannot see
3867	Blinded by the lies they have believed
3868	So, let the Church arise, let the anthem ring
3869	Till all the world has heard of Christ the Risen King
3870	The song of the redeemed boldly we shall sing
3871	The hope of all the world is Christ the Risen King!
3872	The enemies of God are in a rage
3873	Opposing Him, their efforts are in vain
3874	Through every age the gospel will endure
3875	The Spirit’s with the Church forevermore
3876	We, we are not ashamed
3877	For we have a sure foundation in His grace
3878	Yes, we, we are not ashamed
3879	For we have a great salvation in His name
3880	Christ alone, the Life, the Truth, the Way
3881	Lamb of God
3882	Hail the perfect Lamb of God
3883	A kingly ransom paid
3884	When You, my Lord, were slain
3885	Love unrivaled here displayed
3886	Calls my heart to praise
3887	The perfect Lamb of God
3888	The light of day was cloaked by night
3889	And heaven closed its eyes
3890	Wrath unspared for countless sins
3891	The guiltless crucified
3892	Hands of kindness driven through
3893	Back on splintered beam
3894	The holy curtain torn in two
3895	Atonement made for me
3896	Insults mock the Son of God
3897	The angels are restrained
3898	But all the cup must be endured
3899	For sinners to be saved
3900	Can grace prevail in such a day
3901	Of scandal and of scorn?
3902	But with a cry “Forgive” You claim
3903	Traitors as Your own
3904	As You drew Your final breath
3905	My debt was satisfied
3906	And love divine in glorious might
3907	Would vanquish death and rise
3908	Great One in Three
3909	Come now, Almighty King, rule and reign over us
3910	Help us Your praise to sing, Father, glorious
3911	Embracing us before all time
3912	You made us heirs with Christ on high
3913	By Your Spirit now we cry
3914	“Abba, Father”
3915	We long for the day, Great One in Three
3916	We finally behold Your majesty
3917	Face to face, we’ll worship and adore
3918	Forevermore
3919	Speak now, Incarnate Word, of Your relentless love
3920	Bearing our fatal curse with Your living blood
3921	When guilt and doubt come rushing in
3922	Help us see Your cross again
3923	You’re the Rock on which we live
3924	Jesus, Savior
3925	Come, Holy Comforter, give grace to weary hearts
3926	Bring back the wanderer, drive away the dark
3927	You’re the summer of our souls
3928	You’re the fountain of our hope
3929	Our assurance here below
3930	Spirit of the Son
3931	Grace Greater Than All Our Sin - Live
3932	Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
3933	Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
3934	Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
3935	There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt
3936	Grace, grace, God's grace,
3937	Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
3938	Grace, grace, God's grace,
3939	Grace that is greater than all our sin
3940	Dark is the stain that we cannot hide;
3941	What can avail to wash it away?
3942	Look! There is flowing a crimson tide;
3943	Whiter than snow you may be today.
3944	Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
3945	Freely bestowed on all who believe,
3946	All who are longing to see His face,
3947	Will you this moment His grace receive?
3948	I Hear the Words of Love - Live
3949	I hear the words of love,
3950	I gaze upon the blood,
3951	I see the mighty sacrifice,
3952	And I have peace with God.
3953	‘Tis everlasting peace!
3954	Sure as Jehovah's Name;
3955	‘Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
3956	Forevermore the same.
3957	The clouds may come and go
3958	And storms may sweep my sky;
3959	This blood-sealed friendship changes not;
3960	The cross is ever nigh.
3961	My love is oft-times low,
3962	My joy still ebbs and flows;
3963	But peace with Him remains the same;
3964	No change Jehovah knows.
3965	I change, He changes not,
3966	The Christ can never die;
3967	His love, not mine, the resting place,
3968	His truth, not mine, the tie.

3970	Jesus Paid It All - Live
3971	I hear the Savior say,
3972	"Thy strength indeed is small.
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."
3973	Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
3974	Sin had left a crimson stain,
3975	He washed it white as snow.
3976	Lord, now indeed I find
3977	Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
3978	Can change the leper's spots
3979	And melt the heart of stone.
3980	For nothing good have I
3981	Whereby Thy grace to claim;
3982	I'll wash my garments white
3983	In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.
3984	And when, before the throne,
3985	I stand in Him complete,
3986	Jesus died my soul to save,
3987	My lips shall still repeat.

4275	I Asked the Lord That I Might Grow - Live
4276	I asked the Lord that I might grow
4277	In faith and love, and ev'ry grace,
4278	Might more of His salvation know,
4279	And seek more earnestly His face.
4280	'Twas He who taught me thus to pray,
4281	And He, I trust, has answered prayer,
4282	But it has been in such a way
4283	As almost drove me to despair.
4284	I hoped that in some favoured hour
4285	At once He'd answer my request
4286	And, by His love's constraining pow'r,
4287	Subdue my sins, and give me rest.
4288	Instead of this, He made me feel
4289	The hidden evils of my heart
4290	And let the angry pow'rs of hell
4291	Assault my soul, in ev'ry part.
4292	Yea, more with His own hand He seemed
4293	Intent to aggravate my woe,
4294	Crossed all the fair designs I schemed,
4295	Humbled my heart, and laid me low.
4296	Lord, why is this, I trembling cried;
4297	Wilt Thou pursue Thy worm to death?
4298	Tis in this way, the Lord replied,
4299	I answer prayer for grace and faith.
4300	"These inward trials I employ
From self and pride to set thee free
And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me.

And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in me.
When I Survey the Wondrous Cross - Live
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ, my God.
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small.
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

Blessed Assurance

Come, Holy Spirit, my soul assure

Relieve my fears that I no more

May doubt the love of Christ for me

That my debt is paid, that I’ve been made free

O Comforter, in me reside

When the tempter speaks be my faithful Guide

Show Your promise is for me secured

For the battle be my heavenly sword


Blessed assurance; Jesus is mine! Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!

Heir of salvation, purchase of God, born of His Spirit, washed in His blood


Illumine me with the Savior’s light

To dispel my thoughts in the blackest night

In darkest hour to my soul reveal

The wounds which all my sorrows heal

Impress that seal, His image leave

And by Your pow’r to His grace I’ll cleave

Until faith be sight and prayer be praise

When beholding Jesus face to face


This my story, this my song

Born of Spirit, washed in Blood

This my story, this my song

In my Savior I belong
Cling to Christ

Father, I can come to You

And boast of deeds I’ve done

In my pride I strive to earn

The favor Christ has won

He alone pleads my acceptance

All my works aside

So I come with empty hands

And I cling to Christ


Father, I can go astray

And battle needless fears

Voices tell me I’m condemned

And that I can’t draw near

But Your Spirit calls me homeward

With Your words of life

Jesus bore my every sin

So, I cling to Christ


It’s more than I can do

To keep my hold on You

But all my hope and peace

Is that You cling to me


Father, all my earthly aims

In time will turn to dust

Let me learn that loss is gain

For those who know Your love

All the treasures of this world

Will never satisfy

You alone are endless joy

So, I cling to Christ
Abba, Father

Abba, Father! we approach You

In our Savior’s precious name

We, Your children, here assembled

Now Your promised blessing claim

From our sins His blood has washed us

Now we can draw nigh

By the power of Your Spirit

“Abba, Father” now we cry

“Abba, Father” now we cry


Once as prodigals we wandered

Hating what was all our need

But Your grace o’er sin abounding

Rescued us from misery

You the prodigals have pardoned

Kissed us with Your love

Spread the feast and now You’ve called us

E’er to dwell with You above

E’er to dwell with You above


You have found Your once lost children

They now live who once were dead

“It is right,” we hear You saying

“For my people to be glad”


Abba, Father! all adore You

Shout Your praise in Heav’n above

While in us they learn the wonders

Of Your wisdom, grace, and love

Soon before Your throne assembled

Gladly we’ll proclaim:

“Glory, everlasting glory

Be to God and to the Lamb!

Be to God and to the Lamb!”
Our Song from Age to Age

Oh God of power, living Word

The One who made the stars

Who with Your glory filled the earth

From dust made beating hearts

You loved us when we fell away

Poured mercy on our souls

And promised grace would come to save

To loose death’s iron hold


You are our song from age to age

Our voices unite to recount Your praise

Again and again


Oh God of promises fulfilled

The God who took on flesh

Who did all that the Father willed

Was humbled unto death

You bore our cross of sin and shame

Endured our agony

With gladness we now bear Your name

And worship at Your feet


You are our song from age to age

Our voices unite to recount Your praise

Again and again

You are our song from age to age

We will proclaim Your pow’r to save

Again and again


Oh God, who surely guides our steps

Through tempests and through trials

Our Shepherd King, Your way is best

Though tears now veil our eyes

Your steadfast love, our perfect hope

Our eyes are fixed on grace

We have no doubt You’ll lead us home

To finally see Your face


Oh God of all of history

Enthroned in realms of light

What eyes of faith have strained to see

Will one day fill our sight

With all the saints we’ll lay our crowns

Before the Savior’s feet

And sing as all the heav’ns resound

For all eternity

Great Things

To God be the glory, great things He has done

So loved He the world that He gave us His Son

Who yielded His life, an atonement for sin

And opened the life-gate that all may go in


To God be the glory for wisdom and grace

That chose us and made us the heirs of His name

He justified freely His daughters and sons

And gave us His Spirit, the seal of His love


Praise God from whom all blessings flow

Through our Savior Jesus Christ

He has raised us up to a glorious hope

Rejoice, you ransomed ones

Great things He has done


To God be the glory, He joined us with Christ

We share in His death and we’re hid in His life

We stand in His righteousness, never our own

And sit with Him now on His heavenly throne

Prelude
Instrumental
You Have Been Raised
How do we know we’ve been forgiven?
How do we know that we have been made clean?
How do we know we’ll go to heaven?
How do we know we’ve been redeemed?

You have been raised, the tomb has been opened
Nothing can take away our hope in You
You have been raised
You have been raised, the work is completed
Hell and its powers have been defeated
You have been raised

Now we are free from condemnation
There is no judgment left for us to fear
We don’t have to wonder if we’re welcome
You are the One who’s brought us near

The price You paid for us
Has fully been accepted
Because of Your shed blood
We cannot be rejected
Jesus Lives
I no longer fear the grave
Christ has come
Took the sting of death away
Through His saving blood
Though my body fails and my flesh grows weak
Till my final breath, to this hope I’ll cling

Jesus lives and so shall I
I’ll be raised from the dust with Christ on high
Jesus lives no more to die
And when He returns, with Him I’ll rise
Jesus lives

In this fallen world I cry
For the day
When Your glory splits the sky
And You come to reign
All creation waits for that promised hour
When the saints of God are revealed in power

Not death nor any power of hell can separate me from
The love, the love of my Savior
To Live Is Christ
Before You gave us life and breath
You numbered all our days
You set Your gracious love on us
And chose us to be saved
This fleeting life is passing by
With all its joys and pain
But we believe to live is Christ
And death is gain

To live is Christ, to die is gain
In every age this truth remains
We will not fear, we’re unashamed
To live is Christ, to die is gain

And though we grieve for those we love
Who fall asleep in Christ
We know they’ll see the Savior’s face
And gaze into His eyes
So now we grieve, yet we don’t grieve
As those who have no hope
For just as Jesus rose again
He’ll raise His own

And now we’re longing for the day
We’ll see the Lamb once slain
Who saved a countless multitude
To glorify His name
We’re yearning for the wedding feast
Of Jesus and His bride
His nail-scarred hands will finally
Bring us to His side
He Has Risen
Come see the mournful grave
Where once a body lay
Our God in human form
By wrath and judgment torn
But He’s no longer here
His death has conquered death
Our guilt has disappeared
In His forgiveness

Jesus, He has risen
Jesus, He’s alive
Opened the gates of heaven
His death has brought us life

Come see what God has done
For vile and wicked ones
The innocent is judged
Unlovely ones are loved
Our joy is now complete
For death has lost its sting
And we are called to live
Life in His victory

Jesus has done enough
Our hope cannot be shaken
Because God raised Him up
We cannot be forsaken
Your Name Alone Can Save
When we were dead in our transgressions
Jesus, You came to bring us back to God
You canceled the debt that stood against us
Set it aside, nailing it to the cross
Now with joy we can proclaim

You’ve overcome the grave
You took our curse away
There is no other name by which we’re saved
For in Your death we died
In You we have new life
Jesus, Your name alone can save

Now death has lost its sting forever
Because You arose, we do not hope in vain
You defeated every evil power
Disarming them all, bearing our guilt and shame
And forever we’ll proclaim

In Your name there is freedom, life, and peace
In the name above all names
In Your name there is power—darkness flees
At the name above all names
We Have Been Healed
You bore our sins in Your body
As You were hung on a tree
So we might die to rebellion
And live for Him who set us free

You were mocked and reviled
Suffering in our place
Trusting all to Your Father
So enemies could know Your grace

We have been healed, justified
Made alive in the life of Christ
Righteous blood covers every sin
Risen Lamb, heaven’s light
Crucified and now alive
In Your love You have drawn us in

Like straying sheep we were wandering
Destitute and alone
You sought us out like a shepherd
You carried us and brought us home

All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
Hail The Day
Hail the day that Christ arose
Through the skies to worlds unknown
Glorious there He ever reigns
Object of all heaven’s praise

See Him lift His hands above
See the scars of His great love
He has conquered death and sin
Saving all who hope in Him

Hallelujah, hallelujah
The King of Love is on His throne
Hallelujah, hallelujah
His grace will lead us safely home

Though He dwells beyond the stars
His redeemed are on His heart
Even now He intercedes
Jesus cares for all our needs
We Will Rise
A seed falls down from the heights
And is buried in the earth
It silently lies in the ground
Awaiting a rebirth
So it is with those who die
Their lips confessing Christ
Because He is risen
With Him they will rise

Shall we mourn as this world mourns
Or shall we rest in truth?
Though outwardly we waste away
Within we are renewed
The weight of glory far transcends
These momentary trials
Because He is risen
With Him we will rise
We will rise

Weeping may last for an evening
But rejoicing comes with the dawn

To all the wonders God will do
Imagination’s blind
What He has made, He’ll make anew
In the twinkling of an eye
For death itself will be destroyed
Swallowed up by life
Because He is risen
With Him we will rise
We will rise
You Are Our Hope
Comfort for weary sinners
Strength for the struggling saint
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
Peace when the waves are pounding
When voices of hope sound faint
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
How can grief remain when our Savior reigns?

You are our hope, You are our joy
You are our overcoming King
So we sing “Hallelujah, Jesus is alive”
Risen from death, ascended on high
Glorious by the Father’s side
So we sing “Hallelujah, Jesus is alive”

Power to fight temptation
The world and the devil’s lies
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
Purpose in all our suffering
And joy that will never die
Jesus Christ has risen from the grave
How can grief remain when our Savior reigns?

Jesus, victorious, in the heavens exalted
Jesus, give us eyes to see Your glory
Oh, What A Day
Let the joy begin, let our songs ring out
Let our hearts be glad, love has banished doubt
See the empty cross, all our debts are gone
Only grace remains, for the victory’s won

Oh what a day, what a glorious day
Oh what a day, what a glorious day
When You conquered death
And rose up from the grave
What a day
What a day

See the empty tomb, see the grave clothes there
He has left this place, you won’t find Him here
All our fears have fled, let our hopes arise
Heaven waits for us, we will never die

There is still a day that we’re awaiting
When the glorious One we love appears
He will take us home with Him forever
He will finally wipe away our tears
O My Soul, Arise

Arise, my soul, arise

Shake off your guilty fears

The bleeding sacrifice

On my behalf appears

Before the throne my surety stands

Before the throne my surety stands

My name is written on His hands


He ever lives above

For me to intercede

His all redeeming love

His precious blood to plead

His blood atoned for every race

His blood atoned for every race

And sprinkles now the throne of grace


O my soul, arise

Behold the risen Christ

Your Great High Priest

Your spotless sacrifice

O my soul, arise

God owns you as His child

Shake off your guilty fears

My soul, arise


Five bleeding wounds He bears

Received on Calvary

They pour effectual prayers

They strongly plead for me:

“Forgive him, O forgive,” they cry

“Forgive him, O forgive,” they cry

“Don’t let that ransomed sinner die!”


My God is reconciled

His pard’ning voice I hear

He owns me as His child

I can no longer fear

With confidence I now draw nigh

With confidence I now draw nigh

And “Father, Abba, Father,” cry
How Great You Are

Our God is great

The Father of creation

His splendor fills the earth

The lightning crash

The thunder sings His praises

The galaxies can’t help but shout His worth


My soul must sing to You an offering

How great You are

My soul must sing, oh, let the heavens ring

How great You are

Oh, how great You are


The Word made flesh

God’s promise to the fallen

He came with pow’r to save

The light of life was crushed for our rebellion

He died our death and rose up from the grave


Our King will come

With trumpet blasts resounding

To claim His blood-washed bride

He’ll rend the skies, descending in His glory

And in an instant faith will turn to sight

Glorious Christ

The radiance of the Father

Before the dawn of time

You spoke and all creation came to be

The molecules and planets

Reveal Your great design

And every one was made so we could see

So we could see


You are the glorious Christ

The greatest of all delights

Your power is unequaled

Your love beyond all heights

No greater sacrifice

Than when You laid down Your life

We join the song of angels

Who praise You day and night

Glorious Christ


You left the air of heaven

To breathe the dust of earth

And dwell among the outcast and the poor

You came to be forsaken

And died to take our curse

So You could be our joy forevermore

Forevermore


You’re seated now in heaven

Enthroned at God’s right hand

You’ve shattered death and freed us

From our fears

And though we cannot see You

You’re coming back again

And all will be made right when You appear

And all will be made right when You appear
Undone

Your Spirit had awakened

Our lifeless hearts to see

The King in brilliant glory

Revealed in majesty

We were ruined in Your presence

And tearing at the seams

Our eyes had gazed upon the King of kings


We fall down in awe of You

We fall down, undone

We fall down before You, Lord

Undone


Our hands had crafted idols

Our lips had spoken lies

Every wayward thought we had

Against us testified

But You were rich in mercy

To provide what You demand

And now on Christ, the solid rock, we stand


Holy, Holy, Holy One
Spirit of God

The blessing of the Father

Gift of grace and love

The promise of the Savior

For power from above

Oh, wondrous gift that’s given

For confidence and mission

Holy Spirit, You make all things new


Spirit of God, breathe on me now

Source of life, come, revive my weary heart

Spirit of God, shine on me now

Light of life, come, ignite my longing heart


Come and lift the dark clouds

Of doubt and unbelief

Shine upon my soul now

For by Your rays I see

Clearer, closer, deeper

The love of my Redeemer

Holy Spirit, You make all things new


Where You breathe hope thrives

The dead return to life

And the dark must flee the breaking day

By Your light I see the glory of my King

Beholding Him I will be changed

This Is Our God

God, our Father, full of power

Maker of the heavens, Maker of the world

Forming all things, seen and unseen

Truly the Almighty beyond all measured worth

Holy is His Name


We believe the Lord our God is One

Father, Spirit, Son; This is our God!

We believe forever He will reign

Let the church proclaim: This is our God!


Our Lord Jesus sent to save us

Born unto a virgin, lived a perfect life

Greatly suffered, dying for us

From the grave He’s risen, seated now on high

Holy is His Name


Jesus will come back again

To judge the living and the dead

Usher in the age to come

Let everyone sing “Amen”


Spirit, holy, One in glory

Speaking through the prophets

Empowering the Church

Life is given by and through Him

With the Son and Father, worshiped and adored

Holy is His Name
You Stand Alone

You spoke and time began, light dawned at Your command

And by Your Word the earth began to move

Carved mountains with Your hands, breathed life into all men

You made it all and saw that it was good


There is no rival to You, O God

All kings and idols will one day fall


Who among the gods is like You?

Who could ever measure all You’ve done, O God?

Creator, Sustainer, Merciful Savior

Forever on Your throne, You stand alone


Your Spirit gave the Law in kindness to us all

And though we never kept it, You were true

Lawmaker, You have saved lawbreakers from the grave

And by Your Son our guilt has been removed


Your endless glory shines through Your Son

There is no story of greater love


There is no one like our God (You stand alone)
Your Name Is Matchless

We were sinners, we were orphans

We were looking for a home

We were lost and we were broken

Wandering alone

Looking down at our condition

You sent Your Son to change our fate

Though we were hopelessly imprisoned

He came to take our place


Glory to the name of Jesus

Glory to the only name that saves

Ransomed the captives

Your name is matchless


What a mystery to fathom

That we’re Your children set apart

For we were enemies, not pilgrims

Prodigals at heart

But Your Spirit now has caused us

To no longer doubt Your love

Abba, Father, You have bought us

Adopted through Your Son


Glory to the name of Jesus

Glory to the only name that saves

Ransomed the captives

Your name is matchless

Glory to the name that freed us

Glory to the love that made a way

Beauty for ashes; Your name is matchless



Ponder all we have been given:

Heirs to God through Jesus’ name

A stingless death has been made certain

And glory now awaits

Your glory now awaits
Sooner Count the Stars

I could sooner count the stars

Than number all Your ways

Though I only know in part

That part exceeds all praise

As sunlight fills the skies

Your goodness fills my life

For all Your precious gifts

Receive my gratefulness


I could sooner drink the seas

Than fathom all Your love

Like a never ceasing stream

Are mercies through Your Son

The death of Christ alone

Deserves eternal song

For such a love as His

Receive my gratefulness


No praise is high enough

No thanks is deep enough

No life is long enough

To tell of all You’ve done

No shout is loud enough

No words are strong enough

No song is sweet enough

To sing Your love


I could sooner turn back time

Than turn Your heart away

Though the years go fleeting by

Your mercies never change

Before You made the sun

Your love was set on us

For all Your faithfulness

Receive my gratefulness

Gladly Would I Leave Behind Me

Gladly would I leave behind me

All the pleasure I have known

To pursue surpassing treasures

At the throne of God the Son

Worthy of unending worship

Love and loveliness is He

By His precious death were millions

From the jaws of death set free


Gladly would I give to Jesus

All affection, everything

For the washing of His mercy

Makes my ransomed heart to sing

Rising up from those who see

Christ exalted, bright and burning

Full of pow’r and purity


Where else can I go?

Jesus, You’re the One

That I was made to know

What else can I do?

Jesus, You’re my all

I gladly run to You


Gladly would I flee temptations

For their troubles fill my life

Turn and seek my God and Savior

For His goodness satisfies

Earthly treasures, all are passing

Thieves break in and rust destroys

But in God are awesome splendor

Love, and everlasting joys


Gladly would I give to Jesus

All affection, everything

For the washing of His mercy

Makes my ransomed heart to sing

All Is Well

The sun beams on behind the clouds

And in the dark still grace abounds

All is well because of God’s great love

The road of disappointment runs

Where unseen mercies wait for us

And all is well because of God’s great love


How brightly shines the love of the Father

In our Savior, Jesus Christ

With faithful hands He fulfills every promise

He will never leave our side


He feels our weakness, knows our need

And for our good He intercedes

All is well because of God’s great love

Through every failure, every fear

The Lord of comfort draws us near

And all is well because of God’s great love


His coming soon will fill the sky

And all that’s wrong will be made right

With newborn eyes we will behold

The glory of the risen Lord

All will be well because of God’s great love

Yes, all is well because of God’s great love

Immovable Our Hope Remains

Immovable our hope remains

Though shifting sands before us lie

The One who washed away our stains

Shall bear us safely to the skies

The floods may rise, the winds may beat

Torrential rains descend

Yet God His own will not forget

He’ll love and keep us till the end

You’ll love and keep us till the end


This is eternal life: to know

The living God and Christ, the Son

The Savior will not let us go

Until His saving work is done

Our debt was great, as was our need

But now the price is paid

Who can behold Immanuel bleed

And doubt His willingness to save?

We trust Your willingness to save


The Lord acquits, who can condemn?

Though Satan’s accusations fly

His pow’r can never reach our names

To blot them from the Book of Life

The Son has surely made us free

His Word forever stands

And all our joy is knowing we

Are graven on His wounded hands

We’re graven on Your wounded hands


Built into Christ, secure we stand

For with His Spirit we’ve been sealed

By grace we’ll see the promised land

Where every sorrow shall be healed

To God who gave His only Son

To Jesus Christ, our Lord

To God the Spirit, Three-in-one

Be songs of praise forevermore

We’ll sing Your praise forevermore


Mighty Fortress

A mighty fortress is our God

A shield that never fails

Amid the flood of mortal ills

His power will prevail

Our ancient foe is cruel and armed with hate

Yet with one word he’ll bow to Jesus’ reign


Hope in God, O my soul

He is strong and He is strong to save

Hope in God

He’s a rock and your hiding place

He’s a mighty fortress


We dare not trust in our own hand

Or all would be in vain

Our confidence is in the One

Who holds the worlds in place

He fights for us, the sovereign Lord of hosts

From age to age the triumph’s His alone

Father, How Sweet

Father, how sweet must be the pleasure

You find in Your eternal Son

For long before You made the heavens

Both You and He rejoiced as one

And long before You formed the angels

Before You made the day and night

Jesus exulted in Your presence

And He was all of Your delight


Father, what love You’ve shown to rebels

That You would send Your Son so dear

Into this world of grief and trouble

To bring unworthy sinners near

We’ll never fathom how it pained You

When You supplied the offering

To rescue those who had disdained You

To watch Your dear Son suffering


Jesus, it fills our hearts with wonder

That You would leave Your heavenly place

To take on flesh to thirst and hunger

To save the ones who spurned Your grace

You came to forfeit every mercy

To die that mercy we would find

And then You hung alone in darkness

So in our hearts Your grace would shine


Jesus, in glory You’ve ascended

Never again to leave Your throne

Because of You we are befriended

Received and welcomed as God’s own

Father, how sweet now is Your pleasure

In us, Your daughters and Your sons

We will delight in You forever

In Jesus You have made us one

My Redeemer's Love

My Redeemer’s love is deeper

Than the depths of sin and hell

He who was enthroned in glory

Came to bring us to Himself

My Redeemer’s love is wider

Than the breach my sins had made

He reached down into my darkness

He alone has pow’r to save


Deeper than the rolling seas

Higher than the mountain peaks

Your love is all I need


My Redeemer’s love is stronger

Than my fiercest enemies

He will hold me in the tempest

Through the flood He carries me

My Redeemer’s love will lead me

Through the deepest valley here

He will shepherd me and guide me

He will ever keep me near


Deeper than the rolling seas

Higher than the mountain peaks

Your love is all I need

Stronger than the rushing wind

Shattering the power of sin

Your love is all I need


My Redeemer’s love grows sweeter

As eternity draws near

I’ll enjoy His love forever

At His throne for endless years

My Redeemer’s love will fill me

On the day I see His face

I will love Him back forever

And forever sing His praise


Nothing That My Hands Can Do

There’s nothing that my hands can do

To save my guilty soul

I cannot cleanse my filthy stains

Or make my spirit whole

For nothing but the blood of Christ

Can all my sins erase

I dare not claim my righteousness

But hide within His grace

‘Tis Christ who saved me from the depths

God’s pardon I’ve received

I’m washed within His precious blood

My heart is sprinkled clean


I’ll praise the God of holiness

Of justice, truth, and might

Who guides me by His mighty hand

To walk within His light

While Satan weaves his shallow lies

God speaks to me in love

Reminding me His only Son

Has bought me with His blood

And Christ dispels my every doubt

Through Him I am redeemed

I love because He loved me first

I live because He lives


My life is but a fleeting sigh

A tear within the sea

But You are everlasting, Lord

And You’ve predestined me

To leave this fading world behind

Not fearing death will come

For then I’ll look on Jesus Christ

And to His arms I’ll run

And when I see Him face to face

What glory that will be

To look upon my Savior’s scars

And know they were for me

See, He Comes

See, He comes upon the clouds

Jesus Christ, our King appears

All the saints bought by His blood

Will rise to meet Him in the air

Earth and sea shall flee away

All creation waits and groans

For the Lord Redeemer comes

To take His longing exiles home


Hallelujah, hallelujah

Come, O Lord, on earth to reign

Hallelujah, hallelujah

We await the coming day


Those who mocked and scorned His name

Pierced and nailed Him to the tree

Deeply wail, in sorrow grieve

When they the true Messiah see

Every eye will see the Lord

Dressed in dreadful majesty

Every knee shall bow before

The Judge of all eternity


Still He bears the holy scars

Evidence of saving grace

All the saints bought by His blood

Shall then rejoice to see His face

Yes, amen, let all adore

Christ on His eternal throne

All the pow’r and might are Yours

Come, claim the kingdom as Your own

Alive
My heart of stone was dead to You
Asleep within a world
That scorned its maker
Until You breathed into my soul
And I woke up to You
My glorious Savior
You became my all
You became my all

Now I am alive, I am alive in You
You are alive, You are alive in me
You called my name
And raised me from the dead
Now I am alive, I am alive in You

In You my life’s completely new
I’m blameless in Your eyes
Because of Calvary
The Father welcomes me with joy
Your Spirit makes me know
Your great love for me
Jesus, You’re my all
Jesus, You’re my all

Bought with a price that cannot be measured
Chosen before all time
You are my joy, my prize, and my treasure
Jesus, You are my life

4960	His spotless Son for us?
4961	And will the righteous Judge of men
4962	Condemn me for that debt of sin
4963	Now canceled at the cross?
4964	Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
4965	Jesus, You've rescued us
4966	Through Your great love
4967	Complete atonement You have made
4968	And by Your death have fully paid
4969	The debt Your people owed
4970	No wrath remains for us to face
4971	We're sheltered by Your saving grace
4972	And sprinkled with Your blood
4973	How sweet the sound of saving grace
4974	How sweet the sound of saving grace
4975	Christ died for me
4976	Be still my soul and know this peace
4977	The merits of your great high priest
4978	Have bought your liberty
4979	Rely then on His precious blood
4980	Don't fear your banishment from God
4981	Since Jesus sets you free
4982	Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
4983	Jesus, You've rescued us
4984	Through Your great love
4985	How sweet the sound of saving grace
4986	How sweet the sound of saving grace
4987	Christ died for me
4988	How sweet the sound of saving grace
4989	How sweet the sound of saving grace
4990	Christ died for me
4991	Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
4992	Jesus, You've rescued us
4993	Through Your great love
4994	The Father's Love
4995	We do not have the lyrics for The Father's Love yet.
4996	Jesus, Thank You
4997	The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
4998	The agonies of Calvary
4999	You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
5000	Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me
5001	Your blood has washed away my sin
5002	Jesus, thank You
5003	The Father's wrath completely satisfied
5004	Jesus, thank You
5005	Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
5006	Jesus, thank You
5007	By Your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near
5008	Your enemy You've made Your friend
5009	Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
5010	Your mercy and Your kindness know no end
5011	Lover of my soul
5012	I want to live for You
5013	Glory to God in the Highest
5014	Hear the angels sing of the King of kings
5015	Who made Himself poor
5016	See the mystery and the majesty
5017	The Creator is born
5018	Oh the Maker became a man
5019	Let us sing what the angels sang
5020	Glory to God in the highest
5021	Glory to God in the highest
5022	Our hope has appeared
5023	God has drawn near
5024	Glory to God alone
5025	See the One who spans the heavens with His hand
5026	With fingers so small
5027	See this babe so poor all of heaven adores
5028	He's the ruler of all
5029	Let us worship our humble King
5030	Adoration we humbly bring
5031	Create In Me
5032	Create in me a clean heart, oh God
5033	And renew a right spirit within me
5034	Create in me a clean heart, oh God
5035	And renew a right spirit within me
5036	Cast me not away from Thy presence, oh Lord
5037	And take not Thy holy spirit from me
5038	Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
5039	And renew a right spirit within me
5040	Create in me a clean heart, oh God
5041	And renew a right spirit within me
5042	Create in me a clean heart, oh God
5043	And renew a right spirit within me
5044	Cast me not away from Thy presence, oh Lord
5045	Take not Thy holy spirit from me
5046	Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
5047	And renew a right spirit within me
5048	Create in me a clean heart, oh God
5049	And renew a right spirit within me
5050	Create in me a clean heart, oh God
5051	And renew a right spirit within me
5052	Cast me not away from Thy presence, oh Lord
5053	Take not Thy holy spirit from me
5054	Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
5055	And renew a right spirit within me
5056	Taste and See
5057	When I was poor and helpless
5058	The Lord, He heard my cry
5059	He saved this wicked sinner
5060	The King redeemed my life
5061	Oh taste and see that God is good to us
5062	Taste and see His never-failing love
5063	Our God is good
5064	You're near me when I'm broken
5065	My comfort when I'm crushed
5066	My hope in all afflictions
5067	My God in whom I trust
5068	I'll make my boast in Jesus
5069	The One who is my life
5070	His glory is my gladness
5071	In Him I'm satisfied
5072	Out of the Depths
5073	Out of the depths, O Lord, I cry to You
5074	When I am tempted to despair
5075	Though I might fail to trust Your promises
5076	You never fail to hear my prayer
5077	And if You judged my sin
5078	I'd never stand again
5079	But I see mercy in Your hands
5080	So more than watchmen for the morning
5081	I will wait for You, my God
5082	When my fears come with no warning
5083	In Your Word I'll put my trust
5084	When the harvest time is over and I still see no fruit
5085	I will wait, I will wait for You
5086	The secret mysteries belong to You
5087	We only know what You reveal
5088	And all my questions that are unresolved
5089	Don't change the wisdom of Your will
5090	In every trial and loss
5091	My hope is in the cross
5092	I Want to Be Where You Are
5093	How sweet the place where You dwell, O Lord
5094	My soul longs and faints for You
5095	My heart sings out a loud song of joy
5096	For I have known the living God
5097	I want to be where You are, O Lord
5098	I want to be where You are, O Lord
5099	I'd rather have just one day with You
5100	Than be anywhere else
5101	There's no good thing that You will withhold
5102	From those who live to follow You
5103	I'd rather be Your servant, O God
5104	Than have the riches of this world
5105	Those who follow You go from strength to strength
5106	Those who trust in You are filled with joy
5107	Those who follow You go from strength to strength
5108	Those who trust in You are filled with joy
5109	Your Holy Majesty
5110	You are high above all things
5111	The heavens can't contain
5112	Your radiance and Your beauty
5113	You shine brighter than the sun
5114	I'm ravished and undone
5115	You've conquered me completely
5116	Now I am longing for the time
5117	When I will see Your
5118	Holy, holy majesty
5119	Your glory and Your splendor
5120	Holy, holy majesty
5121	You fill my soul with wonder
5122	And unspeakable delight
5123	At just the sight
5124	Of Your holy majesty
5125	Why would You shed Your own blood
5126	For those who spurned Your love
5127	And so many times refused Your grace
5128	Why would You take up our curse
5129	Why did You love us first
5130	Oh You deserve eternal praise
5131	Now I am longing for the time
5132	When I will see Your
5133	Song of the Lamb
5134	Long ago
5135	Before You made the stars above
5136	You set Your everlasting love on us
5137	And Your love endures
5138	With tender cords
5139	You drew us who had strayed so far
5140	And like a might warrior stormed our hearts
5141	Until we were Yours
5142	So we will sing this song of gladness
5143	Lift our hearts and holy hands
5144	We will sing to You who loved us
5145	We'll sing the song of the Lamb
5146	We'll sing the song of the Lamb
5147	All our sins
5148	Have made a chasm deep and wide
5149	We could never reach the other side
5150	'Til You came to save
5151	Glorious God
5152	Emptied to become like us
5153	A humble servant taking up a cross
5154	To pour out Your grace
5155	And Can It Be That I Should Gain (Live)
5156	And can it be that I should gain
5157	An interest in the Savior's blood
5158	Died He for me, who caused His pain
5159	For me, who Him to death pursued?
5160	Amazing love! How can it be
5161	That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
5162	Amazing love! How can it be
5163	That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
5164	He left His Father's throne above
5165	So free, so infinite His grace
5166	Emptied Himself of all but love
5167	And bled for Adam's helpless race
5168	‘Tis mercy all, immense and free
5169	For O my God, it found out me!
5170	Amazing love! How can it be,
5171	That Thou, my God, shoudlst die for me?
5172	Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
5173	Fast bound in sin and nature's night
5174	Thine eye diffused a quickening ray
5175	I woke, the dungeon flamed with light
5176	My chains fell off, my heart was free
5177	I rose, went forth, and followed Thee
5178	Amazing love! How can it be
5179	That Thou, my God shouldst die for me?
5180	No condemnation now I dread
5181	Jesus, and all in Him, is mine
5182	Alive in Him, my living Head
5183	And clothed in righteousness divine
5184	Bold I approach the eternal throne
5185	And claim the crown, through Christ my own
5186	Amazing love! How can it be
5187	That Thou my God, shouldst die for me?
5188	Amazing love! How can it be
5189	That Thou my God, shouldst die for me?
5190	The Power of the Cross (Live)
5191	Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
5192	Christ on the road to Calvary
5193	Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
5194	Nailed to a cross of wood
5195	This, the power of the cross
5196	Christ became sin for us
5197	Took the blame, bore the wrath
5198	We stand forgiven at the cross
5199	Oh, to see the pain written on Your face
5200	Bearing the awesome weight of sin
5201	Ev'ry bitter thought, ev'ry evil deed
5202	Crowning Your bloodstained brow
5203	Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
5204	Quakes as its Maker bows His head
5205	Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
5206	Finished the vict'ry cry
5207	Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
5208	For through Your suffering I am free
5209	Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
5210	Won through Your selfless love
5211	This, the power of the cross
5212	Son of God, slain for us
5213	What a love, what a cost
5214	We stand forgiven at the cross
5215	I Will Glory in My Redeemer (Live)
5216	I will glory in my Redeemer
5217	Whose priceless blood has ransomed me
5218	Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
5219	And hung Him on that judgment tree
5220	I will glory in my Redeemer
5221	Who crushed the power of sin and death
5222	My only Savior before the holy Judge
5223	The Lamb who is my righteousness
5224	The Lamb who is my righteousness
5225	I will glory in my Redeemer
5226	My life He bought, my love He owns
5227	I have no longings for another
5228	I'm satisfied in Him alone
5229	I will glory in my Redeemer
5230	His faithfulness my standing place
5231	Though foes are mighty and rush upon me
5232	My feet are firm, held by His grace
5233	My feet are firm, held by His grace
5234	I will glory in my Redeemer
5235	Who carries me on eagles' wings
5236	He crowns my life with lovingkindness
5237	His triumph song I'll ever sing
5238	I will glory in my Redeemer
5239	Who waits for me at gates of gold
5240	And when He calls me, it will be paradise
5241	His face forever to behold
5242	I will glory in my Redeemer
5243	Who waits for me at gates of gold
5244	And when He calls me, it will be paradise
5245	His face forever to behold
5246	His face forever to behold
5247	His face forever to behold
5248	Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (Live)
5249	Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
5250	Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
5251	Streams of mercy never ceasing
5252	Call for songs of loudest praise
5253	Teach me some melodious sonnet
5254	Sung by flaming tongues above
5255	Praise the name! I'm fixed upon it
5256	Name of Thy redeeming love
5257	Hitherto Thy love has blessed me
5258	Thou hast brought me to this place
5259	And I know Thy hand will bring me
5260	Safely home by Thy good grace
5261	Jesus sought me when a stranger
5262	Wandering from the fold of God
5263	He, to rescue me from danger
5264	Interposed His precious blood
5265	Oh to grace how great a debtor
5266	Daily I'm constrained to be
5267	Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
5268	Bind my wandering heart to Thee
5269	Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
5270	Prone to leave the God I love
5271	Here's my heart, oh take and seal it
5272	Seal it for Thy courts above
5273	Oh that day when freed from sinning
5274	I shall see Thy lovely face
5275	Full arrayed in blood-washed linen
5276	How I'll sing Thy sovereign grace
5277	Come, my Lord, no longer tarry
5278	Bring Thy promises to pass
5279	For I know Thy pow'r will keep me
5280	Till I'm home with Thee at last
5281	Oh the Deep, Deep Love (Live)
5282	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
5283	Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free
5284	Rolling as a mighty ocean
5285	In its fullness over me
5286	Underneath me, all around me
5287	Is the current of Your love
5288	Leading onward, leading homeward
5289	To Your glorious rest above
5290	Oh the deep, deep love
5291	All I need and trust
5292	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
5293	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
5294	Spread His praise from shore to shore
5295	How He came to pay our ransom
5296	Through the saving cross He bore
5297	How He watches o'er His loved ones
5298	Those He died to make His own
5299	How for them He's interceding
5300	Pleading now before the throne
5301	Oh the deep, deep love
5302	All I need and trust
5303	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
5304	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
5305	Far surpassing all the rest
5306	It's an ocean full of blessing
5307	In the midst of every test
5308	Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
5309	Mighty Savior, precious Friend
5310	You will bring us home to glory
5311	Where Your love will never end
5312	Oh the deep, deep love
5313	All I need and trust
5314	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
5315	Oh the deep, deep love
5316	All I need and trust

5318	Oh the deep, deep love
5319	All I need and trust
5320	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
5321	Oh the deep, deep love
5322	All I need and trust
5323	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus!
5324	Oh the deep, deep love
5325	All I need and trust
5326	Is the deep, deep love of Jesus
5327	How Firm a Foundation (Live)
5328	How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord
5329	Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
5330	What more can He say than to you He hath said
5331	To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled
5332	Fear not, I am with thee; oh be not dismayed
5333	For I am thy God and will still give thee aid
5334	I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand
5335	Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand
5336	When through the deep waters I call thee to go
5337	The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow
5338	For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless
5339	And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress
5340	When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie
5341	My grace all sufficient shall be thy supply
5342	The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
5343	Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine
5344	The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
5345	I will not, I will not desert to its foes
5346	That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
5347	I'll never, no never, no never forsake
5348	It Is Well With My Soul (Live)
5349	When peace like a river attendeth my way
5350	When sorrows like sea billows roll
5351	Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
5352	It is well, it is well with my soul
5353	It is well with my soul
5354	It is well with my soul
5355	It is well, it is well with my soul
5356	Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
5357	Let this blest assurance control
5358	That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
5359	And has shed His own blood for my soul
5360	My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought
5361	My sin, not in part, but the whole
5362	Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
5363	Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul
5364	And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight
5365	The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
5366	The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend
5367	Even so, it is well with my soul
5368	All About Jesus
5369	Every word of Your Word is true
5370	They were all breathed out by You
5371	Your Spirit wrote through men
5372	Like a pen in the hand of a God Who knew
5373	That we would need to know how much You love us so
5374	You wrote it down for us forever, Oh
5375	From Genesis to Revelation there's one story of Your great salvation
5376	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5377	Shoutin' out from every page, there's one Hero that'll save the day
5378	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5379	Every word of Your Word gives light
5380	Like the sun that shines so bright
5381	It leads us day by day
5382	To the One, the Way, the Truth, the Life
5383	And every time we read You give us what we need
5384	To grow in grace and know You better, Oh
5385	From Genesis to Revelation there's one story of Your great salvation
5386	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5387	Shoutin' out from every page, there's one Hero that'll save the day
5388	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5389	It's all about Jesus, even from Eden, we read
5390	The serpent would be crushed by a seed of Eve 'cause
5391	All glory belongs to the Son
5392	Every story pointing to the Holy One, like
5393	When Abraham put Isaac on the altar
5394	He pulled the knife, but God, he never falters
5395	Faithful to His promise He would provide
5396	A substitute ram for the sacrifice, now
5397	He gave commandments so we could see
5398	His holiness and our desperate need, then
5399	There were so many temporary sacrifices
5400	None of them were perfect, no, but Christ is
5401	The prophets spoke and they were not liars
5402	God would send His own Son, to be Messiah
5403	Rescue, redeem, restore, reclaim
5404	Every saint loves His holy name, cause
5405	He died on the cross to take our place
5406	The final substitute and eternal grace
5407	Then He rose from the grave and up to the throne
5408	Until He comes again, to gather His own!
5409	From Genesis to Revelation there's one story of Your great salvation
5410	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5411	Shoutin' out from every page, there's one Hero that'll save the day
5412	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5413	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5414	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5415	It's all about Jesus, oh, it's all about Jesus
5416	You're Coming Back
5417	When all His promises come true
5418	When every tear is wiped away and all will be made new
5419	What a great day that will be when Jesus comes back for His own
5420	He will reign eternally from heaven's throne
5421	Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
5422	You're coming back, coming back again
5423	Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
5424	You're coming back, coming back again
5425	Like You said You would, and Your words are true
5426	Oh, that's a fact: You're coming back
5427	Nobody knows the day or hour
5428	When You'll come riding through the skies
5429	But You'll appear in holy power and all will be made right
5430	You'll judge the evil in this world
5431	The time for sadness will be through
5432	And all God's people will rejoice to be with You!
5433	Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
5434	You're coming back, coming back again
5435	Jesus, You're coming back, You're coming back
5436	You're coming back, coming back again
5437	Like You said You would, and Your words are true
5438	Oh, that's a fact: You're coming back
5439	Brick After Brick
5440	God used to dwell in a house among His people
5441	But now He has a home that's better than the first

5472	The Scariest Song
5473	Some say snakes and some say spiders
5474	What strikes terror to your toes?
5475	Some say floods and some say fires
5476	Some say dentist drills or creepy clowns
5477	Climbing up or falling down
5478	But I'll tell you what's the scariest around
5479	Sin–it's the scariest
5480	Sin hurts everyone
5481	Sin–how it hides in us
5482	It's all the wrong we've done
5483	It separates us from our God
5484	Behind these prison walls
5485	Oh, sin is the scariest of all
5486	What's the scariest to you?
5487	Some say living, some say dying
5488	What's the worst thing you can do?
5489	Some say failing when they're trying
5490	Some say getting germs or getting shots
5491	Getting lost or getting caught
5492	But I'll tell you what's the worst thing we have got
5493	Sin–it's the scariest
5494	Sin hurts everyone
5495	Sin–how it hides in us
5496	It's all the wrong we've done
5497	It separates us from our God
5498	Behind these prison walls
5499	Oh, sin is the scariest of all
5500	Since Adam and since Eve sin's spread like a disease
5501	We know that on our own we cannot beat it
5502	But though it seeks to kill, our God is stronger still
5503	And only by His grace can we defeat it
5504	Sin–it's the scariest
5505	Sin hurts everyone
5506	Sin–how it hides in us
5507	It's all the wrong we've done
5508	It separates us from our God
5509	Behind these prison walls
5510	Oh, sin is the scariest of all
5511	Just the Way God Wanted Us to Be
5512	With seas and trees and animals and then He made a man
5513	But Adam he was incomplete, so God gave him a helper, Eve
5514	To carry out His plan
5515	This happy husband and his wife
5516	They showed the world what God is like until they disobeyed
5517	And even though they lost it all we still see fingerprints of God
5518	In everyone He makes
5519	We are the image of the God of all the world
5520	He made us boys, He made us girls
5521	Different pieces of the puzzle joined together perfectly
5522	We are just the way God wanted us to be
5523	We're shades of brown, we're short and tall
5524	But God Himself designed us all unique so we could see
5525	He wants each one to play a part to show the world the Father's heart
5526	To have a family
5527	We are the image of the God of all the world
5528	He made us boys, He made us girls
5529	Different pieces of the puzzle joined together perfectly
5530	We are just the way God wanted us to be
5531	We are the image of the God of all the world
5532	He made us boys, He made us girls
5533	Different pieces of the puzzle joined together perfectly
5534	We are just the way God wanted us to be

5564	Exclamation points abound
5565	To the God of Wow!

5567	Big enough, loud enough
5568	There could be no song that I could
5569	Sing enough or shout enough

5571	But don't know how I just say

5584	Of all the wows below, above
5585	The best of all is Your great love
5586	You're the God of Wow!
5587	One Step at a Time
5588	It seems like it was just yesterday
5589	We had to say we were sorry
5590	And even though we don't want to sin, we fall again every day
5591	It feels like we're pushing a rock that won't move
5592	We want to obey, but it's so hard to do
5593	But if Jesus is Lord, we can be sure
5594	Sin's not in charge anymore
5595	And God's love will lead us
5596	One step at a time as we walk in the light
5597	He's faithful to keep us
5598	One step at a time as He's making us more like Christ
5599	Sin, it camps like an enemy
5600	That's hidden deep down inside us
5601	So, every day we still have to fight
5602	To do what's right, good, and true
5603	But when we grow tired and want to give in
5604	"God gives us power to say ""No"" to sin"
5605	He changes our lives and opens our eyes
5606	So we can bring glory to Christ
5607	And God's love will lead us
5608	One step at a time as we walk in the light
5609	He's faithful to keep us
5610	One step at a time as He's making us more like Christ
5611	In Christ Alone (Live)
5612	In Christ alone my hope is found,
5613	He is my light, my strength, my song;
5614	This Cornerstone, this solid Ground
5615	Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
5616	What heights of love, what depths of peace,
5617	When fears are stilled, when striving cease!
5618	My Comforter, my All in All,
5619	Here in the love of Christ I stand.
5620	In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
5621	Fullness of God in helpless babe.
5622	This gift of love and righteousness,
5623	Scorned by the ones He came to save;
5624	Till on that cross as Jesus die,
5625	The wrath of God was satisfied.
5626	For every sin on Him was laid;
5627	Here in the death of Christ I live.
5628	There in the ground His body lay,
5629	Light of the world by darkness slain;
5630	Then bursting forth in glorious day
5631	Up from the grave He rose again!
5632	And as He stands in victory,
5633	Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
5634	For I am HIs and He is mine,
5635	Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
5636	No guilt in life, no fear in death,
5637	This is the power of Christ in me;
5638	From life's first cry to final breath,
5639	Jesus commands my destiny.
5640	No power of hell, no scheme of man,
5641	Can ever pluck me from His hand;
5642	Till He returns or calls me home,
5643	Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
5644	How Majestic - Live
5645	When I see the stars in heaven
5646	You have flung across the sky
5647	What is man that You should love him
5648	Or that he should catch Your eye
5649	Yet You sent Your Son to die
5650	That we might come to find
5651	Our life in Him
5652	O Lord, our Lord
5653	How majestic is Your name
5654	Majestic is Your name
5655	In all the earth

5662	You are awesome in Your glory
5663	We are sinful and impure
5664	How can we approach the Holy
5665	Who will not one sin endure
5666	Yet You sent Your Son to die
5667	His blood has paid the price
5668	For all our sin
5669	Endless Praises - Live
5670	Look upon this fearful scene
5671	The King of Love nailed to a tree

5680	Let us sing of all our God has done
5681	Look upon this wondrous sight
5682	Foul sinners clothed in white
5683	With the righteousness of Christ
5684	All our guilt is washed away
5685	Every debt we owed is paid
5686	How astounding is this grace
5687	A thousand ages is not long enough
5688	To tell the glories of the Son
5689	Forever we will sing
5690	Redemption's song
5691	And of the victory You've won
5692	Greater Love
5693	You are the mighty Warrior, Lord
5694	Who broke the back of hell
5695	Yet not without great loss of blood
5696	And even death itself
5697	You stripped Yourself of glory
5698	To lift me from the mire of sin
5699	Greater love has never been seen
5700	You paid the greatest price
5701	To make us Your redeemed
5702	Greater love has never been known
5703	No other love's so deep

5709	Yet so much tender mercy
5710	For helpless sinners fills your heart
5711	Your Mercy and Kindness
5712	O Lord You are my shepherd
5713	In You I have no needs

5722	My cup runs over with Your grace
5723	Your mercy and kindness
5724	Pursue me forever
5725	And I'll be with You all my days
5726	O Lord You are my shepherd
5727	Though I walk through death's dark shade
5728	Your rod and staff give comfort
5729	I will not be afraid
5730	O Lord You are my shepherd
5731	A table You have spread
5732	In sight of all my foes, Lord
5733	And You anoint my head
5734	Receive the Glory - Live
5735	Not to us, but to Your name alone

5737	For Your faithfulness and steadfast love
5738	Receive the glory, the glory belongs to You
5739	All that we've accomplished You have done for us

5751	They cannot follow when I enter Your house
5752	So I surrender all to You
5753	I surrender all

5771	God moves in a mysterious way
5772	His wonders to perform
5773	He plants His footsteps in the sea
5774	And rides upon the storm
5775	Deep in His dark and hidden mines
5776	With never-failing skill
5777	He fashions all His bright designs

5779	So God we trust in You

5781	O fearful saints new courage take
5782	The clouds that you now dread
5783	Are big with mercy and will break
5784	In blessings on your head
5785	Judge not the Lord by feeble sense
5786	But trust Him for His grace
5787	Behind a frowning providence
5788	He hides a smiling face
5789	So God we trust in You
5790	O God we trust in You
5791	When tears are great
5792	And comforts few
5793	We hope in mercies ever new
5794	We trust in You
5795	God's purposes will ripen fast
5796	Unfolding every hour
5797	The bud may have a bitter taste
5798	But sweet will be the flower
5799	Blind unbelief is sure to err
5800	And scan His work in vain
5801	God is His own interpreter
5802	And He will make it plain
5803	So God we trust in You
5804	O God we trust in You
5805	So God we trust in You

5823	To bring You glory on this earth
5824	Grace amazing, pure and deep
5825	That saw me in my misery
5826	That took my curse and owned my blame

5829	And brought me to life
5830	Grace clothes me with power
5831	To do what is right

5854	A kingly ransom paid
5855	When You, my Lord, were slain
5856	Love unrivaled here displayed
5857	Calls my heart to praise
5858	The perfect Lamb of God
5859	The light of day was cloaked by night
5860	And heaven closed its eyes
5861	Wrath unspared for countless sins
5862	The guiltless crucified
5863	Hands of kindness driven through
5864	Back on splintered beam
5865	The holy curtain torn in two
5866	Atonement made for me
5867	Insults mock the Son of God
5868	The angels are restrained
5869	But all the cup must be endured
5870	For sinners to be saved
5871	Can grace prevail in such a day
5872	Of scandal and of scorn?
5873	"But with a cry ""Forgive"" You claim"
5874	Traitors as Your own
5875	As You drew Your final breath
5876	My debt was satisfied
5877	And love divine in glorious might
5878	Would vanquish death and rise

5933	You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
5934	Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me
5935	Your blood has washed away my sin
5936	Jesus, thank You
5937	The Father's wrath completely satisfied
5938	Jesus, thank You
5939	Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table

5965	Lover of my soul
5966	I want to live for You
5967	Always Forgiven - Live
5968	I don't deserve to be Your servant
5969	And how much less to be Your child
5970	Anger and wrath, sure condemnation
5971	Should be my portion, my just reward
5972	Never have seen it, never will know it
5973	Your loving kindness enfolds my life
5974	All You have shown me is
5975	Grace, love and mercy
5976	Now and forever I am Your child
5977	Freely You pour out
5978	Your loving kindness
5979	Father of grace
5980	You welcome me in
5981	All of the sin I have committed
5982	Was placed upon Your righteous Son

5993	The ties that none can sever
5994	For I am His and He is mine
5995	Forever and forever
5996	Jesus, friend of sinners
5997	A crown of thorns You wore for me
5998	Bruised for my transgressions
5999	Pierced for my iniquities
6000	The wrath of God that I deserved
6001	Was poured out on the Innocent
6002	He took my place, my soul to save
6003	Now I am His forever
6004	Jesus, friend of sinners
6005	I love to tell the story
6006	Redeeming love has been my theme
6007	And will be when in glory
6008	Not death nor life nor anything
6009	Can ever separate me
6010	O love that will not let me go
6011	Yes, I am His forever
6012	You Are the Way - Live
6013	Dead in transgressions and sins
6014	Without God, without hope in this world
6015	Then the glorious light
6016	Of Your gospel broke in
6017	The Father stood up from His throne
6018	Opened His arms as He called out my name
6019	Grace irresistible drew me
6020	Opened my eyes to see
6021	You are the way
6022	You are the truth
6023	You are the life, Jesus
6024	The only way
6025	The only truth
6026	You are my life, Jesus
6027	You are the source of new life
6028	The giver of every good thing
6029	Withholding nothing
6030	You lavish Your kindness on me
6031	You emptied Yourself, became poor
6032	Humbled and poured out to death
6033	Now highly exalted above all
6034	Your name alone can save
6035	Count It All Joy - Live
6036	Lord I'll count it all joy
6037	When my troubles
6038	Close me in on every side
6039	Lord, I'll count it all joy
6040	When this road of faith
6041	Runs through the darkest night
6042	For I know You're at work in me
6043	Yes I know You'll provide
6044	All the grace I need
6045	You have always been my Rock
6046	I will trust You forever, forever
6047	You have never failed me God
6048	I will trust You forever, forever
6049	Lord I'll count it all joy
6050	When the weight of sorrow
6051	Drives me to my knees
6052	Every heartache and pain
6053	In Your mighty hands
6054	Is forming Christ in me
6055	And I know that Your Word is true
6056	Yes, I know every trial
6057	Will only prove
6058	Who can separate us
6059	From You and Your great love
6060	God's Great Family
6061	When the Father made us
6062	He knew we'd run from Him
6063	And try to hide our sin
6064	But He wanted to save us
6065	His own were on His heart
6066	Before He made the stars
6067	Oh, oh, no one is good, not even one
6068	But God can make us daughters
6069	God can make us sons
6070	Jesus paid the price
6071	When He offered up His life
6072	So we could be part of God's great family
6073	When the Father draws us
6074	It's like a magnet's pull
6075	He's irresistible
6076	When the Spirit calls us
6077	He brings the dead to life
6078	He gives the blind new eyes
6079	Oh, oh, no one is good, not even one
6080	But God can make us daughters
6081	God can make us sons
6082	Jesus paid the price
6083	When He offered up His life
6084	So we could be part of God's great family
6085	When He calls, when He draws
6086	We are His forever
6087	He will never let you go
6088	He will never let you go
6089	When He calls, when He draws
6090	We are His forever
6091	He will never let you go
6092	He will never let you go
6093	Oh, oh, no one is good, not even one
6094	But God can make us daughters
6095	God can make us sons
6096	Jesus paid the price
6097	When He offered up His life
6098	So we could be part of God's great family
6099	(God's great family)
6100	The One who draws us (God's great family)
6101	Calls us into his family (God's great family)
6102	He's irresistible (God's great family)
6103	And we love Him, 'cause He loved us first (God's great family)
6104	In His family (God's great family)
