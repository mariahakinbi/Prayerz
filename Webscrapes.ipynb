      "<p>what will i be doing?  i actually have no idea. i'm a pretty applied person, as opposed to a hardcore researcher, and have experience in a range of areas so my resume looks ok ( even if <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matkelcey/\">my linkedin avatar is the i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing-dog</a> ) some recent robotics experience + lots of machine learning + moving to a farm might result in some interesting ideas. remote work is also a strong possibility; i think there is value i could add to a number of US companies even from across the ocean. to be honest i haven't thought about it too much yet, want to focus on getting everyone home as smoothly as possible first.</p>\n",
      "<p>what's the tech scene like in melbourne?  seemed fun when i was there, lots of smart people and i think interest in machine learning has only been growing. the tech talk i did at our little data science group just before moving here was half a dozen people, the tech talk i did in melbourne about 1 year ago was hundreds of people. when i did neural networks at uni in the late 90s it was embarrassing for the next 10 years to talk about it but these days it seems everyone is wanting to use them in some form. </p>\n",
